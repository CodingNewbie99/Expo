# Expo Template With React Router, StyledComponents, Storybook & Cypress

An alternative template to the current tabs one using more popular libraries:

- ReactRouter instead of react-navigation: a more popular routing library
- StyledComponents instead of react-native stylesheets.: a better rounded css-in-js library with full web styling support for Expo web apps (media queries etc)

We also add some awesome dev and testing utilities:

- storybook for component level testing
- cypress for integration and visual regression testing in chrome (for Expo web apps)
