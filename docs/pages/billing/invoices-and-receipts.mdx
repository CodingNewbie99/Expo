**Receipts** in the Expo dashboard provide information about an account's payment history and access to invoices and receipts. It also lists the historical data, such as payment date, payment status, and the total amount for that payment. You can also request a refund for a charge if you believe it has been made in error.

## Receipts

To view your account's payment history, click [**Receipts**](https://expo.dev/settings/receipts) in the navigation menu under **Account settings** or **Organization settings**.

For example, an [Organization account's](/accounts/account-types/#organizations) receipts are shown below:

/>

> **Note**: You can only access the **Receipts** if you have [Owner or Admin access](/accounts/working-together/#manage-access) to your account.
