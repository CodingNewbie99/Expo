Expo applies usage-based billing for customers who exceed their plan allowances. This enables our customers to use what they need without worrying about limitations or requiring contractual obligations.

Usage-based billing is enabled for EAS Build and EAS Update and is billed monthly. We provide an estimate of your existing usage and any overage charges on your account's [Billing](https://expo.dev/settings/billing).

## How usage-based pricing works

### EAS Build

For EAS Build, a flat fee is charged for an individual build executed at high-priority levels. This is totaled monthly and charged at the end of your billing period or sooner if you cancel your plan.

[Production and Enterprise plans](/billing/plans/#plans) subscribers also receive EAS Build credit that can be used for any combination of builds.

For example, consider an account subscribed to the Production plan which does 15 medium Android builds, and 10 large iOS builds in a billing cycle:

| Description             | Price | Quantity | Total |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Android builds (medium) | $1    | 15       | $15   |
| iOS builds (large)      | $4    | 10       | $40   |
| EAS Build Credit        |       |          | -$55  |
| **Total**               |       |          | $0    |

Since the credit included in the Production plan is higher than the total cost in the above table, the subscriber pays $0 for their 25 builds.

Consider another example where the credit limit has been exceeded:

| Description             | Price | Quantity | Total |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Android builds (medium) | $1    | 20       | $20   |
| Android builds (large)  | $2    | 10       | $20   |
| iOS builds (medium)     | $2    | 15       | $30   |
| iOS builds (large)      | $4    | 15       | $60   |
| EAS Build Credit        |       |          | -$99  |
| **Total**               |       |          | $31   |

In this scenario, the subscriber pays $31 for 60 builds instead of $130 because the EAS Build Credit covers $99.

### EAS Update

Usage-based pricing for EAS Update comprises two metrics: updated users and global edge bandwidth. Updated users track the unique users who download an update in a given billing period. Global edge bandwidth represents the total bandwidth used for all update downloads.

## Monitor usage

To see the current billing cycle's usage summary, go to the [Billing](https://expo.dev/settings/billing) and under **Usage this month**, you will find a summary for both EAS Build and EAS Update usage.

### EAS Build usage history

To see detailed EAS Build usage or usage for a previous billing cycle:

- Click **Usage** in the navigation menu.
- Under the **EAS Build** section, you will find details on builds count and executed builds based on their platform and resource class.

### EAS Update usage history

To see detailed EAS Update usage or usage for a previous billing cycle:

- Click **Usage** in the navigation menu.
- Under the **EAS Update** section, you will find details on updated users and global edge bandwidth details.

### Enable notifications for EAS Build usage

You can enable **Plan credit usage** notifications to closely monitor your EAS Build usage. It enables email notifications when 80% and 100% of your plan's EAS Build credit is used.

To enable EAS Build credit usage notification:

- Click **Email notifications** in the navigation menu.
- Under **EAS Build notifications**, click **Subscribe** for **Plan credit usage notifications**.

### How to optimize build usage

You can use [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/) and [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) to test and deploy new code without having to create an entirely new build. This will help you iterate faster and reduce build usage.

For most apps, the JavaScript code changes more frequently than the underlying native code and configuration. If you are building a new build every time for code changes, consider [using EAS Update to take advantage of the different iterations](/eas-update/how-it-works/) between JavaScript and native code. This way, you can ship those changes as an update instead.

When using Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Deployment (CD) to build pre-production code, you can reduce unnecessary usage by automating the process of building only when changes are made to the native code. You can create a workflow in your CI/CD using [Expo Fingerprint](https://expo.dev/blog/fingerprint-your-native-runtime) to detect when your native code has changed, and only execute a build if it has changed. Otherwise, publish an update if the native code has not changed.

A development build can run any EAS Update that is compatible with its native runtime. If you are using EAS Update with multiple testing channels, you can reduce the need for creating additional builds by having your testers or test devices use the same development build.
