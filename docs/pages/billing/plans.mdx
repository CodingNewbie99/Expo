[Expo Application Services (EAS)](/eas/) offers [free access](https://expo.dev/eas/fair-use#commercial-usage) to a limited quantity of low-priority builds on [EAS Build](/build/introduction/) and free updates via [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/). These limits reset monthly.

Beyond the Free plan, Expo also offers various subscription plans to cater to a variety of customers and their specific needs. Each subscription plan offers credits to enable premium usage of EAS Build as well as wider access to EAS Update, in the form of more users and extra bandwidth. We also offer add-ons that complement subscriptions and enable opt-in features to amplify customer needs.

This page lists different subscription-based plans and available add-ons.

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are billed monthly and are priced the same worldwide (pre-tax). To see our current price list, please refer to our Pricing page at https://expo.dev/pricing.

## Plans

Each plan comes with its own specific limits, but our subscribers can exceed these limits and pay for additional usage with usage-based billing.

### Production

The Production plan is tailored for professional developers and small businesses. Subscribing to the Production plan gets you access to:

- reliable, production-grade services;
- monthly [credits](https://www.notion.so/Usage-based-pricing-0ad51c06a47b4d618b3b564d938ea27e?pvs=21) for high-priority builds for EAS Build; and,
- more unique users, higher bandwidth and storage limit for EAS Update.

When limits have been exceeded or credits are used up, any further usage will be charged at [usage-based prices](https://www.notion.so/Usage-based-pricing-0ad51c06a47b4d618b3b564d938ea27e?pvs=21).

### Enterprise

The Enterprise plan is designed for organizations and enterprises that have large projects, require additional resources and/or dedicated support. As with the Production plan, subscribing to the Enterprise plan gets you access to:

- reliable, production-grade services;
- monthly [credits](https://www.notion.so/Usage-based-pricing-0ad51c06a47b4d618b3b564d938ea27e?pvs=21) for high-priority builds for EAS Build; and,
- more unique users, higher bandwidth and storage limit for EAS Update.

However, the Enterprise plan has a lot more monthly credits for EAS Build and a higher limit for EAS Update than the other plans.

When limits have been exceeded or credits are used up, any further usage will be charged at [usage-based prices](https://www.notion.so/Usage-based-pricing-0ad51c06a47b4d618b3b564d938ea27e?pvs=21).

### On-demand

The On-demand plan is a pay-as-you-go option for developers who have variable usage of our services. You can dial up or down your usage as you see fit and upgrade to our Production or Enterprise plan if needed.

Subscribing to the On-demand plan gets you access to:

- reliable, production-grade services;
- high-priority builds with EAS Build at usage-based prices; and,
- the ability to exceed the limits of the Free plan for EAS Update and pay for additional usage.

### Usage-based billing

Usage-based billing is applied to customers who exceed their plan limits. This enables you to use our services as needed without worrying about limitations or any contractual obligations.

Usage-based billing is billed monthly and is currently enabled for EAS Build and EAS Update. We provide an estimate of your existing usage and any overage charges on your [Billing](https://expo.dev/%5Baccount%5D/billing) page.
