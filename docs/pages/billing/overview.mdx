Expo provides various subscription plans for integrated cloud services through Expo Application Services (EAS). You can manage and track invoices, payments, plans, and other billing-related information on the **Billing** page. Account Owners and Admins have access to this page.

Every newly created Expo account has access to the Free plan. Its billing cycle begins on the first day of each calendar month, and the limits are reset at this time. You can upgrade your plan at any time from the list of available subscriptions and manage them as needed.
