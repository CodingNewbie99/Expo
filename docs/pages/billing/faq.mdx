This page covers frequently asked questions about plans, billing, and payment for Expo Application Services (EAS).

## Plans

### How can I update my plan?

To update your Organization account's plan, make sure that you have either [**Owner** or **Admin** role privilege](/accounts/working-together/#manage-access). For a Personal account, you always have an **Owner** role.

After verifying the role, see [Upgrade to a new plan](/billing/management/#upgrade-to-a-new-plan) to upgrade or [Downgrade a plan](/billing/management/#downgrade-a-plan) to downgrade the existing plan.

### How can I cancel a plan?

See [Cancel a plan](/billing/management/#cancel-a-plan) for more information.

### What if I subscribe from the wrong account?

If you've subscribed to a plan from the wrong account:

- From the Expo dashboard's navigation menu, under **Account**, switch to the account from which you intend to subscribe.
- Go to [**Billing**](https://expo.dev/settings/billing) and under **Plan**, [follow the steps to subscribe to the right plan](/billing/management/#upgrade-to-a-new-plan).
- From the wrong account, go to **[Receipts](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/settings/receipts)** and initiate a [request for a refund](/billing/invoices-and-receipts/#request-a-refund).

### I am on a Free plan and only need a few extra builds

If you are on a Free plan and have completed your monthly quota of free builds, upgrade to the [On-demand plan](https://www.notion.so/Subscriptions-Plans-and-Add-ons-3f928a4b5a944f918cd7cc5a17c91005?pvs=21). It offers a pay-as-you-go option for EAS Build and the same limits as the Free plan for EAS Update. Once your requirements are fulfilled, you can always downgrade to the Free from the On-demand plan.

See [Upgrade to a new plan](/billing/management/#upgrade-to-a-new-plan) to upgrade from the Free to the On-demand plan.

See [Cancel a plan](/billing/management/#cancel-a-plan) to downgrade from On-demand to Free plan.

## Billing

### What constitutes a billing period for a plan?

For the Free plan, the billing cycle starts on the first day of the calendar month.

For all other paid plans, the billing cycle starts from the subscription date of that plan.

### How do I update my billing information?
