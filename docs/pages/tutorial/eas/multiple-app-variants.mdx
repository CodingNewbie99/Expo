In this chapter, we're going to configure our project to run multiple build types (development, preview, production) so that they can be installed simultaneously on a single device. This setup is useful for testing various stages of our app without the hassle of uninstalling and reinstalling different versions.

Our [**app.json**](/workflow/configuration/) file already has IDs for both Android and iOS:

```json app.json
{
  "ios": {
    /* @info */
    "bundleIdentifier": "com.amanhimself.stickersmash"
    /* @end */
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
  "android": {
    /* @info */
    "package": "com.amanhimself.stickersmash"
    /* @end */
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

Each variant needs a unique Android Application ID and iOS Bundle Identifier to run multiple variants on one device.

> We're also going to use this setup in the next chapter when we learn and create internal distribution builds.

<Step label="1">

## Convert app.json to app.config.js for dynamic configuration

**app.json** contains app-related configuration in a JSON file. It's static and doesn't suit our use case if we want to use [dynamic values for certain properties](/workflow/configuration/#dynamic-configuration). We're going to add different Android Application IDs and iOS Bundle Identifiers for all build profiles based on [environment variables](/workflow/configuration/#switching-configuration-based-on-the-environment).

Let's modify it:

- In our code editor, rename **app.json** to **app.config.js**.
- In **app.config.js**, add environment variables called `IS_DEV`, which takes `development` as its value and `IS_PREVIEW`, which takes `preview` as its value:

```js app.config.js
const IS_DEV = process.env.APP_VARIANT === 'development';
const IS_PREVIEW = process.env.APP_VARIANT === 'preview';
```

- Add two functions that dynamically change the app name, Android Application ID and iOS Bundle Identifier:

```js app.config.js
const getUniqueIdentifier = () => {
  if (IS_DEV) {
    return 'com.amanhimself.stickersmash.dev';
  }

  if (IS_PREVIEW) {
    return 'com.amanhimself.stickersmash.preview';
  }

  return 'com.amanhimself.stickersmash';
};

const getAppName = () => {
  if (IS_DEV) {
    return 'StickerSmash (Dev)';
  }

  if (IS_PREVIEW) {
    return 'StickerSmash (Preview)';
  }

  return 'StickerSmash: Emoji Stickers';
};
```

- We'll use `getAppName()` to assign varying `name` values for the app and `getUniqueIdentifier()` to differentiate `android.package` and `ios.bundleIdentifier` for development and preview builds:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js app.config.js
export default {
  /* @info Using getAppName() for "name" property */
  name: getAppName(),
  /* @end */
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  ios: {
    /* @info Using getUniqueIdentifier() for "bundleIdentifier" property */
    bundleIdentifier: getUniqueIdentifier(),
    /* @end */
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
  android: {
    /* @info Using getUniqueIdentifier() for "package" property */
    package: getUniqueIdentifier(),
    /* @end */
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
};
```

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Configure eas.json

In **eas.json**, add the `APP_VARIANT` environment variable:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      /* @info Add env.APP_VARIANT property to access the environment variable for the build profile*/
      "env": {
        "APP_VARIANT": "development"
      }
      /* @end */
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      /* @info Add env.APP_VARIANT property to access the environment variable for the build profile*/
      "env": {
        "APP_VARIANT": "preview"
      }
      /* @end */
    }
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  }
}
```

Running `eas build --profile development` will now set `APP_VARIANT` to `development`.

> **Note**: Since we changed the Android Application ID and iOS Bundle Identifier, the EAS CLI will prompt us to generate a new Keystore for Android and a new provisioning profile for iOS. To learn more about what these steps include, see the previous chapter for more information.

Since our `ios-simulator` build profile extends `development`, this configuration is automatically applied.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Run development server

> After builds are complete, follow the same procedure from previous chapters to install them on a device or emulator/simulator.

Since we're identifying our development build with the `APP_VARIANT` environment variable, we need to pass it to the command when starting the development server. To do this, add a `dev` script in the [`"scripts"`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts) field of our project's **package.json**:

```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "APP_VARIANT=development npx expo start"
  }
}
```

Run the `npm run dev` command to start the development server:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm run dev']} />

This script will evaluate **app.config.js** locally and load the environment variable for the `development` profile.

Now, our development build will run on both Android and iOS, displaying the modified app name from **app.config.js**. For example, the below development build is running on an iOS Simulator. See that the app name is **StickerSmash (Dev)**:

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Development variant running on Android device."
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/ios-dev-variant.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 280 }}
/>

</Step>

## Summary

In this chapter, we:

- Set up various build types on a single device.
- Transitioned from static **app.json** to dynamic **app.config.js** for distinct build identifiers and app metadata such as name.
- Added environment variables in **eas.json** for development and preview builds.
- Introduced a script in **package.json** and initiated the development server with `npm run dev`.

We can go beyond and add more development related indicators (such as a different app icon or splash screen), but for brevity, we are not going to do that in this tutorial. However, you should try it out.
