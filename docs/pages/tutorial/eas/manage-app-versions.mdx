In this chapter, we're going to configure our app to auto-increment the developer-facing app version. Learning about it will be useful before we dive into production build in the next few chapters.

## Understanding developer-facing and user-facing app versions

An app version is composed of two values:

- Developer-facing value: Represented by [`versionCode`](/versions/latest/config/app/#versioncode) for Android and [`buildNumber`](/versions/latest/config/app/#buildnumber) for iOS.
- User-facing value: Represented by [`version`](/versions/latest/config/app/#version) in **app.json**.

Both Google Play Store and Apple App Store rely on developer-facing values to identify each unique build. Once we upload an app with an app version (combination of developer and user facing values), we cannot submit another build with the same app version. Submitting builds with duplicate app version numbers results in a failed submission.

We can manually manage developer-facing values by setting them as `android.versionCode` and `ios.buildNumber` in **app.config.js** and manually update each value for every new production release:

```json app.config.js
{
  "ios": {
    "buildNumber": "1"
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
  "android": {
    "versionCode": "1"
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

However, this manual update process can be streamlined to minimize the room for error before submitting a new production build to app stores. We use EAS Build to automate this process in the next section.

> **Note**: The user-facing version number is not handled by EAS. Instead, we define that in the app store developer portals before submitting our production app for review.

## Automate app version management with EAS Build

EAS Build can assist us in automating these values by utilizing the [remote version resource](/build-reference/app-versions/#remote-version-source). This feature automatically increments developer-facing values and keeps track of them whenever a new production release is made.

In **eas.json**:

- Add `cli.appVersionSource` and set it to `remote`
- Set [`build.production.autoIncrement`](/eas/json/#autoincrement-1) to `true`:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json eas.json
{
  "cli": {
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    /* @info Add the appVersionSource property and set it to remote*/
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
    /* @end */
  },
  "build": {
    "production": {
      /* @info Set the autoIncrement property to true to automatically increment the versionCode or buildNumber */
      "autoIncrement": true
      /* @end */
    }
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

When we create a new production build in the next chapter, the `versionCode` or `buildNumber` will increment automatically (we'll see this in practice in the next chapter).

## Summary

In this chapter, we:

- Learned the difference between developer-facing (`android.versionCode` and `ios.buildNumber`) and user-facing (`version`) app version values.
- Identified the importance of unique app versions to avoid app store rejections.
- Updated **eas.json** to automatically increment developer-facing versions for production builds, using a remote version source for developer convenience.
