In this chapter, we're going to learn about the setup required to configure a development build with EAS for our example app.

## Understanding development builds

Let's start by learning about what are development builds and why we need them.

A [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) is a debug version of our project. It is optimized for quick iterations when creating an app. Using Expo means including the [`expo-dev-client`](/versions/latest/sdk/dev-client/) library, which offers a robust and complete development environment. This setup allows us to integrate any native library or change code inside the [native directories](/workflow/overview/#android-and-ios-native-projects) as required.

## Benefits of creating a development build

> **Note:** If you are familiar with [Expo Go](/get-started/expo-go/), think of a development build as a customizable version of Expo Go that is unique to the requirements of a project.

A development build offers several advantages. Here are some key highlights in comparison to Expo Go:

| Feature                           | Development Builds                                                                                                                             | Expo Go                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development phase**             | Offers web-like iteration speed for mobile app development.                                                                                    | Allows for quick iteration and testing of Expo SDK projects using the client app.                    |
| **Collaboration**                 | Facilitates team testing with shared native runtime.                                                                                           | Easy project sharing via QR codes on a device.                                                       |
| **Third-party libraries support** | Full support for any [third-party library](/workflow/using-libraries/#third-party-libraries), including those that require custom native code. | Limited to libraries within the Expo SDK, not suitable for custom native dependencies.               |
| **Customization**                 | Extensive customization with [config plugins](/config-plugins/introduction/) and direct access to native code.                                 | Limited customization with a focus on Expo SDK capabilities without direct native code modification. |
| **Intended use**                  | Ideal for full-fledged app development aimed at store deployment, offering a complete development environment.                                 | Ideal for learning, prototyping, and experimenting. Not recommended for production apps.             |

<Step label="1">

## Install expo-dev-client library

To initialize our project for a development build, let's [`cd`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#basic_built-in_terminal_commands) inside our project directory and run the following command to install the library:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

### Start the development server

Run the `npx expo start` to start the [development server](/get-started/create-a-project/#start-the-development-server):

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

This command starts the metro bundler. In the terminal window, we see the QR code followed by the `Metro waiting on...`:

  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

Let's notice the changes installing the `expo-dev-client` library has done for us:

1. The manifest URL contains `expo-development-client` along with the app scheme
2. The development server now operates for a development build (instead of Expo Go).

Since we do not have a development build installed on one of our devices or an emulator/simulator, we can't run our project yet.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Initialize a development build

We will use [EAS Build](/build/introduction/), a hosted service for building app binaries, to create our first development build. This service is cloud-based and works for any React Native project.

### Install EAS CLI

To use EAS services, we need to install the EAS Command Line Interface (CLI) tool as a global dependency on our local machine. Run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm install -g eas-cli']} />

> **info** **Tip**: You can also use the above command to check if a new version of EAS CLI is available and then update it. We encourage you to always stay up to date with the latest version.

### Log in or sign up Expo account

> If you have an Expo account and are signed in using Expo CLI, skip this step. If you don't have an Expo account, [sign up here](https://expo.dev/signup) and proceed with the login command described above.

To log in, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas login']} />

This command asks for our EAS email or username and password to complete the login.

> **info** **Tip**: We can use the `eas whoami` command to verify an Expo account's login status and identify the current account, especially useful if managing multiple accounts.

### Initialize and link the project to EAS

For any new project, the first step is to initialize and link it to the EAS servers. Run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas init']} />

On running, this command:

- Requests verification of the account owner by entering our Expo account credentials and then inquires if we want to create a new EAS project:

<ImageSpotlight alt="EAS init command prompt" src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/eas-init.png" />

- Creates EAS project and provides a link to that project (for example, [https://expo.dev/accounts/[acccount]/projects/[project-name]](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Bacccount%5D/projects/%5Bproject-name%5D)) which we can open in the Expo dashboard:

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="New project in Expo dashboard"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/new-project.png"
/>

- Creates a unique `projectId` and links the EAS project to the example app on our developer machine.
- Modifies **app.json** to add [`extra.eas.projectId`](/versions/latest/sdk/constants/#easconfig) and updates its value with the unique ID created. It also adds an `owner` property to the **app.json** file with our Expo account username.

<Collapsible summary={<>What is <CODE>projectId</CODE> in app.json?</>}>

When `eas init` runs, it associates a unique identifier for our project in **app.json** under `extra.eas.projectId`. The value of this property is used to identify our project on EAS servers.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "0cd3da2d-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</Collapsible>

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Configure project for EAS Build

To set up our project for EAS Build, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build:configure']} />

On running, this command:

- Prompts to select a platform: **Android**, **iOS**, or **All**. Since we are creating Android and iOS apps, let's select **All**.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="EAS Build command asks for which platform to select"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/eas-build.png"
/>

- Creates [**eas.json**](/build/eas-json/) in the root of our project's directory with the following default configuration:

```json eas.json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 6.0.0"
  },

  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },

    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },

    "production": {}
  },

  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

The above file does two things:

- Defines the current EAS CLI version.
- Adds three [build profiles](/build/eas-json/#build-profiles): `development`, `preview`, and `production`.

This is the default configuration for **eas.json**. In any project, when we run `eas build:configure` for the first time, we will see this configuration.

</Step>

## Explore development profile

**eas.json** is a collection of different build profiles. Each profile is tailored with distinct configurations to produce specific build types. These profiles can also include platform-specific settings for Android or iOS.

Currently, our focus is on the `development` profile, which includes the following configuration:

- [`developmentClient`](/eas/json/#developmentclient): Enabled (`true`) for creating a debug build. It loads the app using the `expo-dev-client` library, which provides development tools and generates a build artifact for device or emulator/simulator installation and allows using the app for local development as it supports updating the JavaScript on the fly.
- [`distribution`](/eas/json/#distribution): Configured as `internal` to indicate that we want to share the build internally (instead of uploading it on app stores).

> **Note**: Builds are highly customizable and allow further configuration. This includes platform-specific options and the ability to extend configurations from one build profile to another. Learn more about customizing [build profiles](/build/eas-json/#build-profiles).
