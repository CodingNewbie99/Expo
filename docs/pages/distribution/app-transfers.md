Universal apps using EAS have two parts:

1. JavaScript files and assets which are hosted with [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction). These static files are used for over-the-air updates.
2. [Native runtime](/workflow/glossary-of-terms#native-runtime) hosted in the respective app stores. Used for rendering the static hosted assets.
