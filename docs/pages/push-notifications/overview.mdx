Push notifications are an important feature, no matter what kind of app you're building. They are a proven way to help boost user interaction and provide a better user experience by letting app users know about relevant events.

Expo makes implementing push notifications easy. All the hassle with device information and communicating with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) is done behind the scenes. This allows you to treat Android and iOS notifications in the same way and save time both on the front-end and back-end.
