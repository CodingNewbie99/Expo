This guide explains all the steps required to set up push notifications for your app using Expo's notification service, set up credentials for Android and iOS and send a test notification on devices.

To get the client-side ready for push notifications, the following is required:

- The user's permission to send them push notifications
- The user's [`ExpoPushToken`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#expopushtoken) &mdash; if push notifications are mail, then the `ExpoPushToken` is the user's address.

Using [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications) library, you can get a user's permissions using [`requestPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#requestpermissionsasyncrequest-notificationpermissionsrequest-promisenotificationpermissionsstatus) and the `ExpoPushToken` using [`getExpoPushTokenAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#getexpopushtokenasyncoptions-expotokenoptions-expopushtoken).

You'll also use [`expo-device`](/versions/latest/sdk/device) library to check whether the app is running on a physical device. The `expo-notifications` library is not supported on an Android Emulator or an iOS simulator.

{/* TODO @Aman: Edit this part and remove bare workflow. Also investigate expereinceId */}

> In the managed workflow, you don't need to pass any additional options to `getExpoPushTokenAsync`. In the bare workflow, you'll need to pass your `experienceId`. Make sure you read the documentation for more information.

<Step label="1">

## Install libraries

Run the following command to install `expo-notifications` and `expo-device` libraries:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-notifications expo-device']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Add a minimal working example

The code below shows a working example of how to register for, send, and receive push notifications in a React Native app. Copy and paste it into your project:

```jsx App.js
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Text, View, Button, Platform } from 'react-native';
import * as Device from 'expo-device';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
  }),
});

// Can use this function below OR use Expo's Push Notification Tool from: https://expo.dev/notifications
async function sendPushNotification(expoPushToken) {
  const message = {
    to: expoPushToken,
    sound: 'default',
    title: 'Original Title',
    body: 'And here is the body!',
    data: { someData: 'goes here' },
  };

  await fetch('https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json',
      'Accept-encoding': 'gzip, deflate',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(message),
  });
}

async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync() {
  let token;
  /* @info You should also make sure the app is running on a physical device since push notifications won't work on an emulator/simulator. */
  if (Device.isDevice) {
    /* @end */
    const { status: existingStatus } = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();
    let finalStatus = existingStatus;
    if (existingStatus !== 'granted') {
      const { status } = await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync();
      finalStatus = status;
    }
    if (finalStatus !== 'granted') {
      alert('Failed to get push token for push notification!');
      return;
    }
    /* @info This provides the ExpoPushToken. */
    token = (await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync()).data;
    /* @end */
    console.log(token);
  } else {
    alert('Must use physical device for Push Notifications');
  }

  /* @info On Android, you need to specify a channel. Find out more specifics in the expo-notifications documentation. */
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('default', {
      name: 'default',
      importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.MAX,
      vibrationPattern: [0, 250, 250, 250],
      lightColor: '#FF231F7C',
    });
  }
  /* @end */

  return token;
}

export default function App() {
  const [expoPushToken, setExpoPushToken] = useState('');
  const [notification, setNotification] = useState(false);
  const notificationListener = useRef();
  const responseListener = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    registerForPushNotificationsAsync().then(token => setExpoPushToken(token));

    /* @info This listener is fired whenever a notification is received while the app is foregrounded */
    notificationListener.current = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
      setNotification(notification);
    });
    /* @end */

    /* @info This listener is fired whenever a user taps on or interacts with a notification (works when app is foregrounded, backgrounded, or killed) */
    responseListener.current = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
      console.log(response);
    });
    /* @end */

    return () => {
      Notifications.removeNotificationSubscription(notificationListener.current);
      Notifications.removeNotificationSubscription(responseListener.current);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
      <Text>Your expo push token: {expoPushToken}</Text>
      <View style={{ alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <Text>Title: {notification && notification.request.content.title} </Text>
        <Text>Body: {notification && notification.request.content.body}</Text>
        <Text>Data: {notification && JSON.stringify(notification.request.content.data)}</Text>
      </View>
      <Button
        title="Press to Send Notification"
        onPress={async () => {
          await sendPushNotification(expoPushToken);
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Test using Expo Go and push notifications tool

> This step allows testing the push notifications when developing your project using Expo Go. If you are using EAS or [development builds](/development/introduction), you can skip this step and move on to the next one to configure credentials for Android and iOS.

To test the example from the previous step, you can use Expo Go to open the project and the [Expo Push notifications tool](https://expo.dev/notifications) to send a notification to your device.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Expo Push notifications tool overview."
  src="/static/images/notifications/push-notifications-tool-overview.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 1200 }}
/>

Make sure that the development server for your project is running. Then, open the project in the Expo Go app and after the `ExpoPushToken` is generated, enter the value in the Expo Push notifications tool with other details (for example, a message title and body) and click on the **Send a Notification** button.

After sending the notification from the tool, you should see the notification on your device. Below is an example of an Android device receiving a push notification.

<Step label="4">

## Get Credentials for development builds

For Android and iOS, there are different requirements to set up your credentials.

### Android

For Android, you need to configure **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to get your own credentials and set up your Expo project. It is required for all Android apps using Expo SDK (unless you are running your project in Expo Go).

> **warning** FCM is not currently available for `expo-notifications` on iOS.

#### Set up client

1. To create a Firebase project, go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click on **Add project**.

2. In the console, click the setting icon next to **Project overview** and open **Project settings**. Then, under **Your apps**, click the Android icon to open **Add Firebase to your Android app** and follow the steps. **Make sure that the Android package name you enter is the same as the value of `android.package` from your app.json.**

3. After registering the app, download the **google-services.json** file and place it in your project's root directory.

   > The **google-services.json** file contains unique and non-secret identifiers of your Firebase project. For more information, see [Understand Firebase Projects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#config-files-objects).

4. In the **app.json**, add an `android.googleServicesFile` field with the relative path to the downloaded **google-services.json** file. If you placed it in the root directory, the path will be:

   ```json app.json
   {
     "android": {
       "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
     }
   }
   ```

5. For push notifications to work correctly, Firebase requires the API key to either be unrestricted (the key can call any API), or have access to both **Firebase Cloud Messaging API** and **Firebase Installations API**. The API key can be found under the `client.api_key.current_key` field in **google-services.json** file.

   ```json google-services.json
   {
      "client": [
        {
          "api_key": [
            {
              "current_key" "<your Google Cloud Platform API key>",
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
   ```

6. Firebase also creates an API key in the Google Cloud Platform Credentials console with a name like **Android key (auto created by Firebase)**. This is not always the same key as found in **google-services.json**.

7. To be sure that both the `current_key` and the **Android key** in the Credentials console are the same, go to [Google Cloud API Credentials console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and click on **Show key** to verify their value. It will also be marked as **unrestricted**.

   > Firebase projects with multiple Android apps might contain duplicated data under the `client` array in the **google-services.json**. This can cause issues when the app is fetching the push notification token. **Make sure to only have one client object with the correct keys and metadata in google-services.json**.

Now you can re-build the development build using the `eas build` command. At this point, if you haven't created a development build, see [creating development builds](/development/create-development-builds/#on-a-device).

#### Upload server credentials

For Expo to send push notifications from our servers and use your credentials, you'll have to upload your secret server key to your project's Expo dashboard.

1. In Firebase console, next to **Project overview**, click gear icon to open **Project settings**.

2. Click on the **Cloud Messaging** tab in the Settings pane.

3. Copy the token listed next to **Server key**.

   > Server Key is only available in **Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)**, which may be disabled by default. <br/> Enable it by clicking the three-dot menu > **Manage API in Google Cloud Console** and follow the steps there. Once the legacy messaging API is enabled, you should see Server Key in that section.

   <ImageSpotlight
     alt="Getting the server key from Firebase console's Cloud messaging tab."
     src="/static/images/notifications/server-key-from-fcm.jpg"
     style={{ maxWidth: 760 }}
   />

4. In your [Expo account's](https://expo.dev/) dashboard, select your project, and click on **Credentials** in the navigation menu. Then, click on your **Application Identifier** that follows the pattern:`com.company.app`.

   > For Legacy Application Identifiers, run `expo push:android:upload --api-key your-token-here`, replacing `your-token-here` with the string you just copied. We'll store your token securely on our servers, where it will only be accessed when you send a push notification.

5. Under **Server Credentials** > **FCM Server Key** click **Add a FCM Server Key** > **Google Cloud Messaging Token** and add the **Server key** from **step 3**.

   > **warning** Having Service Credentials in both Legacy and non-legacy Application Identifiers can prevent push notifications from working on Android devices. If you have a Legacy Application Identifier, you might need to remove all of its Service Credentials.

### iOS

> **warning** A paid Apple Developer Account is required to generate credentials.

For iOS, make sure you have [registered your iOS device](/development/create-development-builds/#on-a-device) on which you want to test before running `eas build` command for the first time.

If you are creating a development build for the first time, you'll be asked to enable push notifications. Answer yes to the following questions when prompted:

- Set up Push Notifications for your project
- Generating a new Apple Push Notifications service key

<br />

> If are you using bare workflow and not using EAS Build, you will need to run `eas credentials` manually.

### Test using push notifications tool

After creating and installing the development build, you can use Expo's Push notifications tool to send a test notification to your device.
