Handling notifications with Expo is straightforward across all platforms. You can use event listeners from [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications) library to handle how your app responds when receiving a notification and how to set the behavior of the push notifications when your app is in the foreground.

## Notification event listeners

The `addNotificationReceivedListener` and `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener` event listeners receive an object when a notification is received or interacted with.

These two different listeners allow you to address cases where a notification comes in while your app is open and foregrounded, **and** cases where a notification comes in while your app is backgrounded or closed, and the user taps on the notification.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  registerForPushNotificationsAsync().then(token => setExpoPushToken(token));

  /* @info This listener is fired whenever a notification is received while the app is foregrounded. */
  notificationListener.current = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
    setNotification(notification);
  });
  /* @end */

  /* @info This listener is fired whenever a user taps on or interacts with a notification (works when an app is foregrounded, backgrounded, or killed). */
  responseListener.current = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
    console.log(response);
  });
  /* @end */

  return () => {
    Notifications.removeNotificationSubscription(notificationListener.current);
    Notifications.removeNotificationSubscription(responseListener.current);
  };
}, []);
```

For more information on these objects, see [`Notification`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#notification) documentation.

## Foreground notification behavior

To handle the behavior when notifications are received when your app is **foregrounded**, use [`Notifications.setNotificationHandler`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#handling-incoming-notifications-when-the-app-is) with the `handleNotification()` callback to set the following options:

- `shouldShowAlert`
- `shouldPlaySound`
- `shouldSetBadge`

```jsx
Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
  }),
});
```

## Closed notification behavior

On Android, users can set certain OS-level settings (**usually** revolving around performance and battery optimization), that can prevent notifications from being delivered when the app is closed. For example, one such setting is the **Deep Clear** option on OnePlus devices using Android 9 and lower versions.
