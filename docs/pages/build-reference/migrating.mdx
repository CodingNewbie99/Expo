title: Migrating from "expo build"
---

import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

This reference page provides some practical differences that you should know when migrating your Expo [managed app](/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#managed-workflow) from `expo build` (also known as **classic builds**) to EAS Build. If this is your first time using EAS Build, you can use this page as a companion to [Creating your first build](/build/setup).

EAS Build is to make it as easy as possible to migrate from `expo build`. For example, your app signing credentials will be automatically re-used, and the Expo SDK and your [Expo config](/workflow/configuration/) (**app.json**) configuration will all work the same as before. That said, there are some differences in the build process that may require additional configuration or small code changes.

### SDK 41+ apps are supported

EAS Build only supports SDK 41 and above managed projects. You must upgrade your project to migrate to EAS Build. For more information, see [upgrading Expo SDK](/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/).

### Expo config `userInterfaceStyle` depends on `expo-system-ui` being installed

Selecting a native appearance mode with `userInterfaceStyle` (or `android.userInterfaceStyle`) in the Expo **app.json** will only work on Android if `expo-system-ui` is installed in the project. This is because `expo-system-ui` includes code for locking the interface natively based on the **app.json**.

Run the following command to install the `expo-system-ui` library:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-system-ui']} />

This feature is only supported in **Expo SDK 43 and above**.

### Expo config `backgroundColor` depends on `expo-system-ui` being installed

Selecting the root background color (for native modals and flipping orientations) with `ios.backgroundColor` in the project's **app.json** will only work on iOS if `expo-system-ui` is installed in the project. This is because `expo-system-ui` includes code for setting the color natively based on the **app.json**.

Run the following command to install the `expo-system-ui` library:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-system-ui']} />

This feature is only supported in **Expo SDK 43 and above**.

> **For bare workflow**: You can also remove references to `RCTRootViewBackgroundColor` in the `AppDelegate.m` file as this is now handled inside the `expo-system-ui` module.

### Expo config `androidNavigationBar` depends on `expo-navigation-bar` being installed

Selecting the navigation bar interaction behavior with `androidNavigationBar.visible` in the project's **app.json** will only work on Android if `expo-navigation-bar` is installed in the project. Also consider migrating away from this property as the underlying Android APIs are deprecated: For more information, see the [migration guide](https://expo.fyi/android-navigation-bar-visible-deprecated).

Run the following command to install the `expo-navigation-bar` library:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-navigation-bar']} />

This feature is only supported in **Expo SDK 43 and above**.

### Expo config `splash` depends on `expo-splash-screen` being installed

Configuring the `resizeMode` or positioning of the splash screen with `splash` (or `android.splash`) in the project's **app.json** will only work on Android if `expo-splash-screen` is installed in the project.

Run the following command to install the `expo-splash-screen` library:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-splash-screen']} />

This feature is only supported in **Expo SDK 43 and above**.

### Only libraries included in your package.json are included in the resulting standalone app

This often results in massive reductions in app size. Managed apps built with EAS Build can be [10x smaller than the same app built with `expo build`](https://blog.expo.dev/expo-managed-workflow-in-2021-5b887bbf7dbb). The tradeoff here is that you need to be careful when publishing updates to avoid publishing an incompatible JavaScript bundle. For more information, see [using EAS Update](/build/updates).

### Only files in your project folder that are not ignored in Git are uploaded to the build server

EAS Build builds your app like other CI services â€” in short, the entire project is uploaded securely to the cloud, then it is downloaded by a build server, the dependencies are installed, and the build is run. For more information, see the [iOS build process](/build-reference/ios-builds) as an example.

Everything needed to build your app must be included in the project that is uploaded. The default mechanism for packaging your project is roughly equivalent to `git clone --depth 1`, and so anything that is in your `.gitignore` will not be uploaded. For more information, see [How projects are uploaded to EAS Build](https://expo.fyi/eas-build-archive).

Developers often run into this with the **Google Services File**, which they reference in **app.json** but ignore in Git. If anything in your project is ignored in Git but necessary for a successful build, you can either remove it from `.gitignore` and commit it, or [encode with base64 and store in EAS Secrets, then decode at build time](https://expo.fyi/eas-build-archive#how-can-i-upload-files-to-eas-build-if-they-are-gitignored).

### The `--config` flag is not supported

You may be use `expo build:[ios|android] --config app.production.json` to switch app configuration files used by your project &mdash; this is not supported in EAS Build, but it's easy to migrate to an alternative. For more information, see [Migrating away from the `--config` flag in Expo CLI](https://expo.fyi/config-flag-migration).

### No more automatic publishing before building

With classic builds, the default behavior is to automatically publish your app with Classic Updates as an update prior to running a build. This had some unintended consequences. For example, sometimes developers would run a build and be surprised to learn that their existing app was updated as a side effect.

With EAS Build, the Classic Update's `expo publish` command is not run as part of the build process. Instead, the JavaScript bundle is generated locally on EAS Build at build time and directly embedded in the app.

Since we no longer publish at build time, `postPublish` hooks in **app.json** will not be executed on build. If you use Sentry, make sure to update `sentry-expo` library to the latest version and follow the updated instructions in [Using Sentry](/guides/using-sentry/#configure-a--postpublish--hook). If you have other custom `postPublish` hooks, you can follow the same approach used in `sentry-expo` to support `postPublish` hook type of behavior.

### `Constants.manifest` does not include update related fields until updated

Given that we no longer publish the app prior to builds, there is no update manifest available until the app has download an update. Usually this means that at least for the first launch of the app you won't have some fields available. If you are using `Constants.manifest` to access update fields, in particular `Constants.manifest.channel`, you should switch to `Updates.channel` instead from the `expo-updates` library.

### `Constants.appOwnership` will be `null` in the resulting standalone app

The `Constants.appOwnership` field no longer exists in standalone apps produced by EAS Build. If you were previously testing the environment with something similar to `const isStandaloneApp = Constants.appOwnership === "standalone"` then you can invert the logic: `const isStandaloneApp = Constants.appOwnership !== "expo"`.

### All assets referenced in source code are bundled

With classic builds, `assetBundlePatterns` serves two purposes:

1. Assets that match the given patterns are bundled in the binary at build time.
2. Assets that match the given patterns determine the contents of an "atomic" update bundle. All of the files matching `assetBundlePatterns` need to be downloaded before an update is considered ready to launch.

Only the second purpose applies with the new build system. All assets referenced in your app source code are bundled into your app binary at build time, the same as in a default React Native app &mdash; `assetBundlePatterns` is not used to determine what assets to bundle in the binary, it's only used for update bundles.

### Custom `"main"` entry point in package.json is not yet supported

If your app depends on a custom `"main"` entry point, remove it from **package.json**. Then, create **index.js** at the root of your project and use [registerRootComponent](/versions/latest/sdk/register-root-component/) to register your root component. For example, if your app's root component lives in **src/App.tsx**, the **index.js** should look like the following:

```js index.js
import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';
import App from './src/App';

registerRootComponent(App);
```

Support for custom entry points is in progress and is coming soon.

### Monorepos may require additional setup

Classic builds had no knowledge of your repository set up. You could use a monorepo or birepo or trirepo, the service was entirely indifferent. As long as you were able to publish a bundle, that's all that was needed. EAS Build needs to be able to install all of your project dependencies and essentially set up your development environment inside of a worker, so in some cases that will require some additional configuration. For more information, see [How to set up EAS Build with a monorepo](/build-reference/how-tos#how-to-set-up-eas-build-with).

### Environment variables used by your app need to be defined for EAS Build

If you use environment variables in your **app.config.js** or in your app source code (for example, with `babel-plugin-inline-dotenv`), you need to define these variables for your build profiles or in secrets, as described in [Environment variables and secrets](/build-reference/variables). With classic builds this was not necessary because your app JavaScript was always built on your development machine (when you publish the app bundle prior to building), but now the app JavaScript is built in an EAS Build worker.

### Additional configuration is required to access private npm packages

See [Using private npm packages](/build-reference/private-npm-packages) for more information on how to securely store `NPM_TOKEN` on EAS Build.

### `expo-branch` is not supported on EAS Build

You will need to remove `expo-branch` from your app to build it with EAS Build. For **EAS Build**, you need to use the official [react-native-branch](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/react-native-branch-deep-linking-attribution) with [@config-plugins/react-native-branch](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins/tree/master/packages/react-native-branch).

### `amazon-cognito-identity-js` is required if you use AWS Amplify

In projects built with `expo build` the native primitives required by AWS Amplify are included in every app. This is not the case in EAS Build, and you must install `amazon-cognito-identity-js` to link the native module depended on by AWS Amplify libraries.

### Animated WebP is not supported by default

Most apps do not use this format and support for it adds around 3.4 MB to the final app size, so it is omitted by default. You can enable it by switching `expo.webp.animated=false` to `expo.webp.animated=true` using a custom [Config plugin](/guides/config-plugins/) to update **android/gradle.properties**. For more information on how to implement the config plugin, [see this example](https://forums.expo.dev/t/animated-webp-expected-to-work-with-eas-builds/58960/5?u=notbrent) from the community.

### metro.config.js must export the entire default config from `expo/metro-config`

> `expo/metro-config` is a versioned re-export of `@expo/metro-config`.

Previously, with classic builds, your **metro.config.js** might have looked something like:

```js metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

module.exports = {
  resolver: {
    assetExts: [...defaultConfig.resolver.assetExts, 'db'],
  },
};
```

In the example above, you're only exporting _part_ of the default config. However, EAS Build requires the _full_ config. To do that, you have to modify `defaultConfig` directly, and then return the resulting object as shown below:

```js metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

defaultConfig.resolver.assetExts.push('db');

module.exports = defaultConfig;
```

If you don't set up your **metro.config.js** file properly, your assets could fail to load in release builds.
