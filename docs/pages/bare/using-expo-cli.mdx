title: Using Expo CLI
description: Learn how and why you can use Expo CLI instead of @react-native-community/cli in any React Native project.

import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

To use the local Expo CLI in a project created with `npx react-native init`, you will first need to install the `expo` package. This package includes the Expo Modules API and Expo CLI. For a complete explanation of how to install this, see the ["Install Expo modules" guide](/bare/installing-expo-modules.md). For most apps, it's as simple as running the following command in your project directory:

<Terminal cmd={['npx install-expo-modules@latest']} />

## Compiling and running your app

Once you have the `expo` package installed, you can use the `npx expo run:ios` and `npx expo run:android` commands as alternatives to `npx react-native run-ios` and `npx react-native run-android`. You can pass in the `--device` flag to select a device/simulator to build for â€” this also works for any connected iOS device.

## Starting the bundler

`npx expo run:[android|ios]` will start the bundler/development server. You can skip that by passing in `--no-bundler` flag. Start the development server independently with `npx expo start --dev-client`.

## Why we think you should use it instead of `npx react-native`

Expo CLI commands provide several benefits over the similar commands in `@react-native-community/cli`, including:

- Open up the Hermes debugger in one keystroke: <kbd>j</kbd>.
- [Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild.mdx) makes upgrading your native projects to new React Native versions easier, among other benefits.
- View native logs directly in the terminal.
- [Automatic TypeScript support](/guides/typescript.mdx).
- [Automatic web support](/guides/customizing-metro.mdx/#adding-web-support-to-metro).
- Integrates with [expo-dev-client](/develop/development-builds/introduction.mdx).
- Improved native build log formatting by using Expo's own `xcpretty`-style tool that is built specifically for React Native apps.
- It runs `pod install` automatically when needed.
- `npx expo install` picks known compatible versions of dependencies for well-known packages.
- `npx expo run:[android|ios]` and `npx expo start` automatically detect if another app is running on the default port and suggests using a different one.
- Built-in support for serving your app over an [ngrok tunnel](/develop/development-builds/development-workflows.mdx/#tunnel-urls), which is useful for testing on physical devices on restricted networks.
- Support for [expo-router](https://expo.github.io/router/docs).

## Learn more

With the `expo` package installed and configured in your project, you can use every feature from Expo CLI. Refer to the [Expo CLI reference](/more/expo-cli.md) for more details.
