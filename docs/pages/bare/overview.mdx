A bare React Native app is a project where developers make direct changes to their native **android** and **ios** project directories rather than continuously generating ([with CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)) them using [app config](/workflow/configuration/) and [prebuild](/workflow/prebuild).

All tools and services provided by Expo, including [EAS](/eas), [Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/), and [Expo SDK libraries](/versions/latest/), work great whether you use CNG to generate your native directories or you modify them directly (bare workflow).
