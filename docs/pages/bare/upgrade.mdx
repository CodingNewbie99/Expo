You don't have to use prebuild blah blah you lose some benefits but you can check in your own native projects and use them with Expo blah blah

## Upgrading to the next Expo SDK version

If you're using your own native projects, you'll need to upgrade them to the next Expo SDK version when you upgrade your Expo project.

In addition to running `npm install expo; npx expo install --fix`, you may need to modify the files inside your ios and android folders blah blah.

### Upgrade based on a diff

You can use this diff tool to see what changes you need to make to your native projects to bring them up to date with your Expo SDK version.

Choose your from SDK version and to SDK version to see the diff. Then apply those changes to your native projects.
