If you manage your own native projects (also known as bare workflow), when [upgrading to the latest Expo SDK](/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/), you'll typically need to make some changes to your native projects. Use the diffs here to compare native project files between your current SDK version and your desired target SDK version, so you can make the changes needed to match the template used by your version of the `expo` package. The tools on this page is similar to [React Native Upgrade Helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/), but it is oriented around projects that use Expo modules and related tooling.

## Upgrade your native project files

Once you have [upgraded your Expo SDK version and related dependencies](/workflow//upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/#how-to-upgrade-to-the-latest-sdk-version), you can use this diff tool to see what changes you need to make to your native projects to bring them up to date with your Expo SDK version.

Choose your from SDK version and to SDK version to see the diff. Then apply those changes to your native projects by copying and pasting or manually making changes as needed.
