If you want to use parts of the Expo SDK in your existing React Native app, you are in the right place.

Most packages in the Expo SDK depend on the module tooling installed with the [`expo`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo) package. Once it is installed and configured in your app, you can install other packages from the Expo SDK just as you would any other React Native library.
