description: An introduction to EAS Insights which is a preview service for projects using the expo-insights library.
---

**EAS Insights** is a service that offers a view into a project's performance,
usage, and reach. We are currently offering a preview of Insights that is
available to all developers, and we will continue to roll out new features and
functionality based on user feedback and suggestions.

EAS Insights makes it easy to see the state of your app, providing information
about usage across platforms, app store versions, and timeframes.

### Integration with EAS Update

For those using `expo-updates` with EAS Update, we're able to provide certain
high-level usage insights without any additional client-side changes. This is
possible due to the nature of EAS Update + expo-updates, where clients check for
available updates and fetch them if possible. Data about these client requests
is aggregated into a limited Insights view that shows usage over time, as well
as usage broken down by platform.

### The New `expo-insights` Module

To get the most of EAS Insights functionality, we offer the `expo-insights`
client module. Developers can add this module to their project and gain more
precise usage metrics, as well as additional breakdowns by app store version.
Right now the `expo-insights` module is limited to sending client events only
pertaining to cold starts of the app, but in the future we will expand
`expo-insights` to offer new types of events and payloads, to support more
advanced Insights functionality.
