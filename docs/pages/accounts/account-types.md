An Expo account is a container that holds Expo projects and allows for different amounts of collaboration. There are three types of Expo accounts; Personal, Team, and Organization. What type of account you choose to put a new project in depends on the nature of the project and, if you plan to collaborate with others, with whom you plan to collaborate.

When you [sign up for an account](https://expo.dev/signup) with Expo, a Personal Account is automatically created for you. If you want multiple members to have access to project(s), you can create an Organization Account.

Before Organization accounts, the only way to work in a group was to add members directly to a Personal Account. This was called a Team Account. Only the original member can have an Owner role in a Team Account. An Organization Account can have multiple members with the Owner role. You can choose whichever account type that makes the most sense for your group. Both group account types allow the following:

- Sharing projects
- Assigning member permissions (only one Owner in a Team Account)
- Sharing an [EAS Subscription](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/)

Original or added Owners can invite and assign members of their group a role. This role determines what actions they can or can not perform. Four types of roles are available:

- Owner
- Admin
- Developer
- Viewer

Each role has different privileges. Learn more about [role privileges](/accounts/working-together/#managing-access).

> **Note**: You can switch between accounts or create a new Organization Account from the dropdown in the top left corner. If you want to convert your Personal Account to an Organization Account, select the avatar from the top right corner of the dashboard and then select User Settings.

## Personal Accounts

When you sign up a Personal Account is automatically created for you. This account is a good place to work on your personal projects.


> **Note**: You must not share authentication credentials for your Personal Account with anyone for any reason. Members can log in to their Personal Accounts to access any Team or Organization they are part of. Access to these accounts is available from the dropdown in the top left corner of the dashboard on [expo.dev](https://expo.dev).

## Teams

> **Note**: For all new accounts where you want to share access, we recommend you [create a new Organization](#organizations) Account. It allows more flexibility in role assignments and allows you to keep some projects private to you. However, a Team Account is still a viable way to give other users access to all your projects, just keep in mind that granting someone access to your account grants them access to all of your personal projects.

To create a Team Account, simply [invite Team members](/accounts/working-together/#adding-members) to a Personal Account. An email will be sent that prompts them to create a Personal Expo Account if they do not already have one. In a Team Account, the team's creator has the Owner role only.

For members to access the Team projects, they select the Ownerâ€™s account name from the dropdown in the top left under "Teams". The Owner can login to their Personal Account and manage it as usual.

## Organizations

An Organization Account is useful for creating a project that may outlive your involvement. If you are working on a shared project with other members of a company or a group of developers, we recommend you [create an Organization](expo.dev/create-organization) Account.

It may be useful to create an Organization when:

- You think you may need to transfer control of a project in the future. Organizations are transferred more easily than personal projects.
- More than one Owner needs to be assigned.
- Expenses need to be isolated.
- Structuring projects for different contexts. For example, when working for different clients, a new organization may be created for each client.

### Creating new Organizations

To create a new Organization, log in to your Personal Account and [open the link](https://expo.dev/create-organization) to create a new organization.

Alternatively, if you are logged in to your Personal Account, you can create a new Organization from the dashboard:

- Select your account's username from the top menu bar. It will open a dropdown menu.
- Select Create Organization under Organizations in the dropdown menu.

- Choose a name for your Organization and select the Create button.

<ImageSpotlight alt="Enter a name of your new organization." src="/static/images/accounts/enter-name-org.jpg" style={{maxWidth: 720}} />

After creating a new Organization, you are redirected to the new dashboard page for the organization. To associate a new project with the Organization, you have to add the [Owner key](/versions/latest/config/app/#owner) under the `"expo"` key to your project's **app.json**.

### Converting Personal Accounts into Organizations

You can convert your Personal Account into an Organization when you want to share access to projects with other members and assign each member a role-based privilege.

From the User Settings of your Personal Account, go to [Convert your account into an organization](https://expo.dev/settings#convert-account) section to start the process.

When you are going through this process, we take a lot of care to make sure that all of the functionality that you and your users rely on will continue to work as expected:

- You can continue to deliver updates and push notifications to your users.
- You will still be able to use any iOS or Android credentials stored on Expo's servers.
- Any integrations using your personal access token or webhooks will continue to operate and are transferred to the new designated owner.
- Your EAS subscription will continue without interruption.
- Your production apps will continue to operate without interruption.

The Organization Account will adopt your old username. Converting a Personal Account into an Organization Account requires that you designate a new user as the owner of the Organization account. You will have the opportunity to designate an existing user or sign up as a new user during the account conversion process.

The example below is Step 3 in the conversion process on a Personal Account with the username "kamalaya8":

<ImageSpotlight alt="Example demonstrating the Step 3 of the conversion process." src="/static/images/accounts/converting-personal-account.jpg" style={{maxWidth: 720}} />

After completing the conversion process, you can no longer log in as the old Personal Account's user. To continue using Expo services, you will log into [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/) with the user you selected or created to manage the Organization Account. Then, select the organization from the top left dropdown to access the organization.


### Renaming an Account

Accounts can be renamed a limited number of times. Only Owners can rename accounts. Visit [the account settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/settings) and follow the steps under [Rename Account](https://expo.dev/settings#rename-account).

<ImageSpotlight alt="Rename Account settings panel." src="/static/images/accounts/rename-account.jpg" style={{maxWidth: 720}} />

#### Caveats

After renaming an account, new publishes to projects within the account must be on Expo SDK 43 or above.

### Transferring projects between Accounts

Projects can be transferred a limited number of times. A user must be an Owner or Admin on both source and destination accounts to transfer projects between them. Visit [the project settings page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/settings) and follow the steps under Transfer project.

<ImageSpotlight alt="Transfer Projects settings panel." src="/static/images/accounts/transfer-project.jpg" style={{maxWidth: 720}} />

#### Caveats

Before transferring a project, make sure that your it is on Expo SDK 43 or above. If not, you must upgrade it and rebuild it for OTA updates to continue to work on that project.

> **Note**: If you want to transfer the ownership of a project from your Personal or Organization Account (source) to another person or company (destination), and you cannot be given "Owner or "Admin" permissions on the destination account, you can create an escrow account (a new Organization Account). This solves the problem that a user must be an "Owner" or "Admin" on both source and destination accounts to transfer projects between them. Once the escrow account is created, you can grant the ultimate destination account member the Owner role on the escrow account and safely transfer the project to the escrow account. The receiving person or company can then transfer it to their destination account from the escrow account without having had access to the destination account itself.
