Just as Expo projects can use third-party React Native packages containing native code, Expo projects are also ready for you to add your own custom native code to your project. Once you create your first [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/), you can use any native library or custom native code in your local development environment, as well as in your production app. Development builds work just like Expo Go, allowing you to quickly run your app from the [Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/), except they include all your specific native dependencies and customizations, and not just what is included with the latest [Expo SDK](/versions/latest/).

For most third-party native modules, thanks to [autolinking](/modules/autolinking/), all you need to do is install the package and create a new development build in order to start using the module's functionality. Some modules will also require you setup a [config-plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) to take care of other native customizations. For writing your own custom native code, below are a few options to consider.

## Create a local module with the Expo Modules API

By default, Expo projects use [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation). This means that projects do not have **android** and **ios** folders containing the native code and configuration used to build the app. Instead, the native projects are generated just before they are built based on your [Expo Config](/workflow/configuration) native modules in **package.json**. This simplifies the management and upgrading of native code, but means you cannot edit the native code directly.

However, you can still add custom native code to a project using CNG by [creating a local Expo module](modules/get-started/#creating-the-local-expo-module). Local Expo Modules are just like [Expo Modules](/modules/overview/) created by package developers and those used within the Expo SDK itself, but they are not published to npm. Instead, they are created directly inside of your project. This allows you to write custom Swift and Kotlin code that you can interact with from your JavaScript coe, and is included in your development builds and production apps automatically when you build with [EAS Build](/build/introduction) or when you build locally with `npx expo run:[android|iOS]`.

## Manage your own native projects

If you want to opt out of CNG and instead directly manage the code and configuration inside your Android and iOS native projects, you can generate native directories by running `npx expo prebuild` or `npx expo run:[android|iOS]` (which will run `prebuild` automatically). You can also use development builds in this context &mdash; run `npx expo install expo-dev-client` before `prebuild` or `run`.

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Build your native Android project',
    '$ npx expo run:android',
    '',
    '# Build your native iOS project',
    '$ npx expo run:ios',
  ]}
  cmdCopy="npx expo run:android && npx expo run:ios"
/>

- `npx expo run:android` requires Android Studio and the Android SDK to be installed. See how to [setup environment](/guides/local-app-development/#android).
- `npx expo run:ios` requires Xcode (macOS only) installed on your computer. See how to [setup environment](/guides/local-app-development/#ios).

The `run` commands will [prebuild](/workflow/prebuild/) your project to generate all the native code within your project directory. If you manually modify the **android** or **ios** directory, you cannot re-run `npx expo prebuild` safely, as this may overwrite your changes.

If you install a library with Expo [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/), you'll need to follow a few steps:

- Add the plugin to the [`plugins`](/versions/latest/config/app/#plugins) array in the project's app config.
- Re-run `npx expo prebuild` to sync the changes before rebuilding the native app. This process often involves tasks like adding required permissions to the **AndroidManifest.xml** or **Info.plist**.
- For complex plugins, consider running `npx expo prebuild --clean`. This command will delete and re-generate the native directories from scratch.

### Manual changes to the native project files

If you manually modify the **android** and **ios** directories, you must set up new libraries manually. Running `npx expo prebuild` may not work as expected because the project is now in an unpredictable state (think of this like running `yarn` after manually modifying your **node_modules** directory).

If you want to make static changes to your native project files, such as **AndroidManifest.xml** or **Info.plist**, and still have access to prebuilding, then create a [config plugin](/config-plugins/plugins-and-mods/#create-a-plugin) to see how you can hook into the prebuild process to make those changes.

### Revert changes from `npx expo run:[android|ios]`

Suppose you have decided to roll your app back to being fully managed (no **android** or **ios** directories in your project directory). In that case, you can check out your most recent commit before executing `npx expo run:[android|ios]`, then run `npm install` again to restore the state of your **node_modules** directory.

### Develop apps with custom native code

Once you have customized the native code in your project, you can use the [`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-an-expo-dev-client) library to create a development build and retain the convenience of working with JavaScript or TypeScript in Expo Go. You can [create a development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) for your managed or bare workflow.

## Release apps with custom native code to production

When you're ready to ship your app, you can [build it with EAS Build](/build/introduction) the same as you were building it before adding custom native code. Alternatively, you can archive and sign it locally. Unsurprisingly, we recommend EAS Build!

<Terminal
  cmd={['# Install the CLI', '$ npm i -g eas-cli', '', '# Build your app!', '$ eas build -p all']}
  cmdCopy="npm i -g eas-cli && eas build -p all"
/>

## Create reusable native modules

As well as being used for adding custom code to single projects, the [Expo Modules API](/modules/overview) enables developers to build reusable modules for Expo and React Native projects using Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript. These modules are often published to npm; they can also be included as separate packages within a [monorepo](/guides/monorepo). We use the Expo Modules API for most modules in the [Expo SDK](/versions/latest). Learn more about the [Expo Module API design considerations](/modules/overview).

Another option is to use [React Native's Core Native Modules API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro), which may require some C++ knowledge in addition to Objective-C and Java. Most React Native modules in the ecosystem are built using this API because it is and always has been part of React Native. The Expo Module API is new and intends to solve many of the pain points of using the core API.
