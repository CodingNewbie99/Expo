This document outlines how to trigger builds on EAS for your app from a CI environment such as GitHub Actions, Travis CI, and more.

Before building with EAS on CI, we need to install and configure `eas-cli`. Then, we can trigger new builds with the `eas build` command.

## Prerequisites

### Run a successful build from your local machine

To trigger EAS builds from a GitHub, we first need to configure our app for EAS Build and successfully run a build from our local machine for each platform that we'd like to support on GitHub.

If you have run `eas build -p [all|ios|android]` successfully before, then you can continue.

If you haven't done this yet, please refer to the [Creating your first build](setup.mdx) guide and return here when you're ready.

## Configure your app for GitHub

### Link your GitHub repository to your Expo project

Visit your project's [GitHub settings
page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[projectName]/github).

Install the Expo GitHub App on your GitHub account.

/>

Link your GitHub account to your Expo account.

> **Note:** You must be an admin of the Expo account to install the app. Also, You can only link GitHub
> organizations to Expo organizations.

Then, you'll be able to link
your repository to your Expo project.

### Configure your repository settings

Before running a build, we need to know where to find the source code for your project. If your Expo
project sourse code is in the root of your repository, then you don't need to do anything. If your
Expo project source code is in a subdirectory, then you'll need to configure "Base directory"
settings for your repository on your project's [GitHub settings
page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[projectName]/github).

## Trigger a build from GitHub

Once you've configured your app for GitHub, you can trigger a build from GitHub by using the UI on
your project's builds list page or by labels on your GitHub PRs.

### Trigger a build from the UI

Visit your project's [builds list
page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[projectName]/builds) and click the "Build from
GitHub" button. You'll be prompted to select a Git ref (branch/commit/tag), a platform to build
for and the build profile to apply to it.

You can also specify a base directory for this specific build. That will not change the global
settings for this project.

### Trigger a build from a GitHub PR

You can trigger a build from a GitHub PR by adding a label to the PR. The label must be in the form
of `eas-build-[platform]:[profile]` where `[platform]` is either `android`, `ios`, or `all` and
`[profile]` is the name of a build profile specified in your **eas.json** file. If you don't specify
a build platform, it will default to `all`. If you don't speficy
a build profile, it will default to `production`.

For example, if
you want to trigger a production build for Android, you would add the label `eas-build-android` to the PR.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="A PR with the eas-build label and live status checks"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/eas-build-label.png"
/>

The build will be triggered for the latest commit on the PR's base branch. You can view the status
of the build in the PR's checks. A link to the build will be available in the check's details.
