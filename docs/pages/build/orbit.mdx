Expo Orbit for macOS makes it faster and easier to install and run builds from EAS or elsewhere, and to run Snack projects on simulators and physical devices.

<Video file="orbit/basic-features.mp4" />

The process for installing builds from EAS (Android device/emulator, iOS simulator/device) and running Snack projects on simulators used to be more manual than it needs to be. You could use `eas build:run` and select a build for Android devices/emulators or iOS simulators, or you could download the archive, extract it, and drag and drop it to the simulator/emulator. For Snack projects, additional steps include installing Expo Go in the simulator through the CLI, logging in, and selecting the Snack from a list. Orbit makes these steps as seamless as possible.

## Highlights

- List and launch simulators, including the ability to run Android emulators without audio
- Install and launch builds from EAS to your simulators and real devices in one click
- Launch Snack projects in your simulators in one click
- Install and launch apps from local files using Finder or just drag and drop a file into the menu bar app. Orbit supports any Android APK, simulator compatible **.app**, or ad hoc signed apps
- See pinned projects and quickly launch your latest builds

## Installation

You can download Orbit via Homebrew or directly through [GitHub](https://github.com/expo/orbit/releases).

<Terminal cmd={['$ brew install expo-orbit']} />

If you want Orbit to automatically start when you log in, click on the Orbit icon in the menu bar, then "Settings" and select the "Launch on Login" option.

> **info** Orbit relies on the Android SDK and `xcrun` for device management, which requires having both Android Studio and Xcode set up.

At this point in time, Orbit is compatible only with macOS but we have exciting plans to integrate it further into the Expo ecosystem and add even more features. Try out Expo Orbit now, explore its capabilities, and share your feedback.
