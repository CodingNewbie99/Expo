When creating an EAS Build for iOS, an Apple Developer account is required. This account has necessary permissions to submit the app for review, manage app's distribution, and generate required [app signing credentials](/app-signing/managed-credentials/#generating-app-signing-credentials) such as certificates, identifiers, and profiles.

If the Apple Developer account is an individual account, only the account owner can generate the app signing credentials. This guide provides steps that the account owner has to follow to ensure app signing credentials are generated. It also provides steps for the team developer to create an EAS Build.

> See [Apple's documentation on Program Roles](https://developer.apple.com/support/roles/) for details on the different roles and their permissions based on the type of Developer account.

## Steps for Apple Developer account owner

The owner of the individual Apple Developer account needs to generate a distribution certificate (if submitting an app to the App Store), provisioning profile, or a push key (if submitting an app to use a push notification service).

Once the owner login to their [Expo account](/accounts/account-types/), they can create or update the provisioning profile by running `eas credentials` using the EAS CLI.

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas login', '', '$ eas credentials']} />

The CLI will prompt for selecting a [build profile](/build/eas-json/#build-profiles) to use for the EAS Build. If the owner is creating a production build, follow the the steps to [create a distribution provisioning profile](/tutorial/eas/ios-production-build/#create-a-distribution-provisioning-profile). To create a developer build, follow the steps to [create a provisioning profile](/tutorial/eas/ios-development-build-for-devices/#provisioning-profile).

This ensures that the provisioning profile associated with the Expo account has necessary permissions.

## Steps for the team developer

As a developer on the team, when running `eas build -p ios` in the terminal window, the EAS CLI will ask you to login to an Apple Developer account.

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '? Do you want to log in to your Apple account? > (Y/n)',
    '',
    'No problem! ðŸ‘Œ If any of the next steps will require Apple account access we will ask you again about it.',
  ]}
/>

Press <kbd>n</kbd> for not logging to the Apple Developer account if you don't have access (and avoid logging into your personal Apple Developer account, if any). The prompt will only ask you to generate the app signing credentials haven't been generated yet.

The EAS CLI needs to use the provisioning profile associated with the Expo account to create a build for iOS. After pressing <kbd>n</kbd>, the CLI prompts a message about skipping provisioning profile validation and other app signing credential validation and will continue creating the EAS Build.

EAS Build will use the last provisioning profile and other credentials that were updated by the Apple Developer account owner in your organization's Expo account.

## Important note

### Provisioning profile expiry and updates

The associated provisioning profile needs to be updated if certain [iOS capabilities](/build-reference/ios-capabilities/) (such as, entitlements) are added or removed, or at the annual expiry of the profile. This step is handled by the Apple Developer account owner.
