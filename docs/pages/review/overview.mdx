This page outlines different strategies to share a preview version of your app using internal distribution and EAS Update. Sharing a preview version of your app with testers allows them to download and run it on their devices, as if it were distributed through a store.

## Internal distribution

Internal distribution is a strategy for sharing an app with a limited audience. It is used for testing purposes within a team or organization or a selected group of testers, or even by an individual developer that is testing their own app. Android and iOS provide different ways to install a build of your application directly on a device.

Google Play beta provides both closed and open tracks. You can invite specific users to test your app in the closed beta. In the open beta, you can make your app available to anyone participating in the beta program. You could alternatively distribute the APK directly to testers.

Apple offers ad hoc provisioning to distribute your app to test on devices registered to your Apple Developer account. You can also use TestFlight to share your app with up to 10,000 external testers by [uploading your app](/submit/ios/).

EAS Build makes it easy to generate a shareable URL that your team can use to download an installable APK for Android or an ad hoc provisioned app for iOS.

## Using EAS Update with development builds

You can use [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) to load previews of your app during the review stage by publishing the preview with EAS Update.

Even though Expo Go is an open-source sandbox that can be good for previewing isolated prototypes on Android and iOS, it is not intended for production apps. It should be avoided during the preview process of your app.

You can use a development build with EAS Update and see the getting started guide for further instructions to set up the `expo-updates` library and learn how to create a link between a build and an update.

EAS Update allows you to push updates to iterate faster with your team. You can publish a new update for your team to preview. This process allows any team member or reviewer with a registered device to review the latest version of your app by scanning a QR code.

If you have the `expo-dev-client` library installed in your project, your team can launch different app versions and preview a published update inside the development build. It supports loading published EAS updates through channels.

You can also use GitHub Actions to automate the process of publishing updates. It makes deploying updates consistent and fast, leaving you more time to develop your app.
