[Expo Orbit](https://expo.dev/orbit) is a macOS app designed to speed up installing and running builds from EAS. It also launches updates directly from the Expo dashboard on Android Emulators and iOS Simulators.

> **Note**: Launching updates using Expo Orbit is currently supported only for Android Emulators and iOS Simulators.

## Prerequisites

- **Install the Orbit** app before following the steps in this guide. You can download it directly from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/expo/orbit/releases) or see the [alternative method](/build/orbit/#installation) to install it.
- After installing the app, sign in to your Expo account from **Settings**.
- You'll also need a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) installed on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator with the same [runtime version](/eas-update/runtime-versions/) as the update.

Previewing an update with Expo Orbit is a two-step process:

<Step label="1">

### Publish an update

Start by [publishing an update](/eas-update/getting-started/#publish-an-update) on your project. Use the command below and replace it with your specific development profile as the `[branch]` name and a `[message]` describing the update.

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --branch [branch] --message [message]']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

### Install and launch the update

After the update is published, follow these steps to open it on an Android Emulator or iOS Simulator:

- Navigate your project's **Updates** tab
- Select the update you want to preview
- Under **Platform-specific updates** section, click the three-dotted menu next to the target platform and select **Open in Orbit**
- Orbit will install and launch the update on the selected Android Emulator or iOS Simulator

</Step>

You can now seamlessly launch and review updates using Expo Orbit.

> **Note**: If you are [building your app locally](/guides/local-app-development/) and are using EAS Update, click **Launch with deep link** when prompted.
