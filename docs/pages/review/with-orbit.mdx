[Expo Orbit](https://expo.dev/orbit) is a macOS and Windows app designed to speed up installing and running builds from EAS. It also launches updates directly from the Expo dashboard on Android Emulators and iOS Simulators.

> **Note**: Launching updates using Expo Orbit is currently supported only for Android Emulators and iOS Simulators.

## Prerequisites

- **Install the Orbit** app before following the steps in this guide. You can download it directly from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/expo/orbit/releases) or see the [alternative method](/build/orbit/#installation) to install it.
- After installing the app, sign in to your Expo account from **Settings**.
  {/* - You'll also need a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) installed on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator with the same [runtime version](/eas-update/runtime-versions/) as the update. */}

Previewing an update with Expo Orbit requires you to have a published update. If you haven't published an update, see the steps in [Publish an update](/eas-update/publish-updates/) before following steps in the next section.

### Install and launch the update

After the update is published, follow these steps to open it on an Android Emulator or iOS Simulator:

- Navigate your project's **Updates** tab
- Select the update you want to preview
- Under the **Platform-specific updates** section, click the three-dotted menu next to the target platform and select **Open in Orbit**
- Orbit will install and launch the update on the selected Android Emulator or iOS Simulator

You can now seamlessly launch and review updates using Expo Orbit.

### How does automatic installing and launching an update work

If you've created a development build with EAS Build, at the time of installing and launching the update, the same runtime version and target platform are used from the development build. If a compatible update is found, it will be automatically installed and launched on the development build.

If you don't use EAS Build and are [building your app locally](/guides/local-app-development/), click **Launch with deep link** when prompted.
