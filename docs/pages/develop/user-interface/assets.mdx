description: Learn about using local and remote assets.

Files such as images, videos, sounds, database files for SQLite, or fonts are considered **assets**. They are not part of your project's JavaScript but are part of your app.

Your project can use two types of assets: **Local** and **Remote**. This guide will explain how to use both types of assets.

## Local assets

These assets are stored on your file system and can be imported like JavaScript modules using `require` or `import` statements.

For example, to render an image called **example.png** in **App.js**, you can directly use `require` to import the image from the project's **assets/images** directory and pass it to the `<Image>` component:

```jsx App.js
<Image source={require('./assets/images/example.png')} />
```

The bundler automatically provides a width and height for the images imported, as shown in the above example. For more information, see [Static Image Resources](https://reactnative.dev/docs/images#static-image-resources).

Libraries such as `expo-image` and `expo-file-system` work similarly to the `<Image>` component with local assets.

### How are local assets served

Local assets used this way are served over HTTP in development. They are automatically bundled into your app binary at the build time for production apps and served from disk on a device.

### Load a local asset at build time

> **Note:** The `expo-asset` config plugin is only available for SDK 51 and above. If you are using an older SDK, you can load a [using the `useAssets` hook](/versions/v51.0.0/sdk/asset/#useassetsmoduleids).

Install the `expo-asset` library and add the config plugin to the app config file. This plugin will embed the asset file in your native project.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-asset",

        {
          "assets": ["./assets/images/example.png"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The `assets` option takes an array of one or more asset files or directory names to link the file to the native project. The path to each file is relative to the project's root.

When you [create a new native build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/), you can import and use the asset in your project without using a `require` or an `import` statement.

For example, the **example.png** is linked by the above config plugin. You can directly import it into your component:

```jsx App.js
import { Image } from 'expo-image';
/* @hide ... */ /* @end */

function App() {
  return <Image source="example" />;
}
```

> **info** For more information on supported file formats used with the config plugin, see [Assets API reference](/versions/v51.0.0/sdk/asset/#configurable-properties).

### Load a local asset at runtime

Install the `expo-asset` library in your project. Once the installation step is complete, import the `useAssets` hook from the `expo-asset` library. The hook downloads and stores an asset locally, and after the asset is loaded, it returns a list of that asset's instances.

```jsx App.js
import { useAssets } from 'expo-asset';

export default function App() {
  const [assets, error] = useAssets([
    require('path/to/example-1.jpg'),
    require('path/to/example-2.png'),
  ]);

  return assets ? <Image source={assets[0]} /> : null;
}
```

## Remote assets

Remote assets are not bundled into binaries at build time. You can use the URL of the asset resource in your project if it is hosted remotely. For example, pass the URL to the `<Image>` component to render a remote image.

```jsx App.js
import { Image } from 'expo-image';
/* @hide ... */ /* @end */

function App() {
  return (
    <Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/logo.png' }} style={{ width: 50, height: 50 }} />
  );
}
```

There is no guarantee about the availability of images served remotely using a web URL because an internet connection may not be available, or the asset might be removed.

Additionally, loading assets remotely also requires you to pass the metadata. In this example, the bundler cannot retrieve the image's metadata (width and height), and you have to pass it explicitly to the `<Image>` component. If you don't, the image will default to 0x0.

## Manual optimization methods

### Images

You can also compress images using any other online service or a tool such as:

- [`guetzli`](https://github.com/google/guetzli)
- [`pngcrush`](https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush/)
- [`optipng`](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)

Some image optimizers are lossless. They re-encode your image to be smaller without any change or loss in the pixels displayed. When you need each pixel to be untouched from the original image, a lossless optimizer and a lossless image format like PNG are a good choice.

Other image optimizers are lossy. The optimized image differs from the original image. Often, lossy optimizers are more efficient because they discard visual information that reduces file size while making the image look nearly identical to humans. Tools like `imagemagick` can use comparison algorithms like [SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) to show how similar two images look. It's quite common for an optimized image that is over 95% similar to the original image to be far less than 95% of the original file size.

### Fonts

See [Wait for fonts to load in the Fonts guide](/develop/user-interface/fonts/#wait-for-fonts-to-load) for more information.

### Other assets

For assets like GIFs or movies, or non-code and non-image assets, it's up to the developer to optimize and minify those assets.

> **Note**: GIFs are a very inefficient format. Modern video codecs can produce smaller file sizes by over an order of magnitude.
