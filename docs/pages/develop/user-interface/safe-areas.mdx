Creating a safe area ensures your app screen's content is positioned correctly. This means it doesn't get overlapped by notches, status bars, home indicators, and other interface elements. When the content gets overlapped, it gets concealed by these interface elements.

Here's an example of an app screen's content concealed by the status bar on Android. On iOS, the same content is concealed by rounded corners, notch, and the status bar.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Without defining a safe area, the content can be obscured by the device's interface elements."
  src="/static/images/safe-area/without-safe-area.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

## Use `react-native-safe-area-context` library

[`react-native-safe-area-context`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) provides a flexible API for handling Android and iOS device's safe area insets. It also provides a `SafeAreaView` component that you can use instead of a [`<View>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) to account for safe areas automatically in your screen components.

Using the library, the result of the previous example changes as it displays the content inside a safe area, as shown below:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="On using react-native-safe-area-context, the content is positioned within the safe area."
  src="/static/images/safe-area/with-safe-area.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

### Installation

You can skip installing `react-native-safe-area-context` if you have created a project using [the default template](/get-started/create-a-project/). This library is installed as peer dependency for Expo Router library. Otherwise, install this library by running the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context']} />

### Usage

<Step label="1">

Import and add [`SafeAreaProvider`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context#safeareaprovider). If your project uses Expo Router, add it to the [root layout (**app/\_layout.tsx**)](/develop/file-based-routing/#_layout-file) file. Otherwise, add it to the root component file (such as **App.tsx**).

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <Stack>
        <Screen name="index" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
      </Stack>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** In the above example, the `Stack` is wrapping one screen. Your project's root layout file may have more than one screen. The `index` screen is used here an example to represent a screen component.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Use [`SafeAreaView`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context#safeareaview) to wrap the content of your screen's component. It is a regular `<View>` with the safe area insets applied as extra padding or margin.

```tsx app/index.tsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Text>Content is in safe area.</Text>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

</Step>

## Alternate: `useSafeAreaInsets` hook

Alternate to `SafeAreaView`, you can use [`useSafeAreaInsets`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context#usesafeareainsets) hook in your screen component. It provides direct access to the safe area insets, allowing you to apply padding for each edge of the `<View>` using an inset from this hook.

The example below uses the `useSafeAreaInsets` hook. It applies top padding to a `<View>` using `insets.top`.

```tsx app/index.tsx
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: insets.top }}>
      <Text>Content is in safe area.</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

The hook provides the insets in the following object:

```ts
{
  top: number,
  right: number,
  bottom: number,
  left: number
}
```

## Additional information

### Minimal example

Below is a minimal working example that uses the `useSafeAreaInsets` hook to apply top padding to a view.

<SnackInline label="Using react-native-safe-area-context" dependencies={['react-native-safe-area-context']}>

```tsx collapseHeight=320
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { SafeAreaProvider, useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function HomeScreen() {
  const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: insets.top }}>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 28 }}>Content is in safe area.</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <HomeScreen />
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
}
```

</SnackInline>

### Usage with React Navigation

By default, React Navigation supports safe areas and uses `react-native-safe-area-context` as a peer dependency. For more information, see the [React Navigation documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/handling-safe-area/).

### Usage with web

If you are targeting the web, set up `SafeAreaProvider` as described in the [usage section](#usage). If you are doing server-side rendering (SSR), see the [Web SSR section](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context#web-ssr) in the library's documentation.
