Android and iOS come with their own set of platform fonts. To provide a consistent user experience and enhance your app's branding, you can use custom fonts.

This guide covers different ways you can incorporate a custom font into your app and also provides additional information.

## Get a custom font

To use a custom font in your project, you need to add a font file. To show how to use a custom font with different methods, this guide is going to use Inter Black font. It is available from the open source [Inter font family](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson.

After downloading the font file, copy the file into your project's **assets/fonts** directory.

> **info** **assets/fonts** directory path is a common convention in React Native apps to put font files. You can place these files if elsewhere if you follow a custom convention.

### Supported font formats

Expo SDK officially supports OTF and TTF font formats across Android, iOS and web platforms. If your font is in another font format, you have to set up advanced configuration to support that format in your project.

### How to choose between OTF and TTF

If the font you're using have both OTF and TTF versions, prefer OTF.

OTF is a newer format and **.otf** files are smaller than **.ttf** files. Sometimes, OTF also renders slightly better in certain contexts.

## Use a custom font

Two ways to use a custom font in your project are:

- Embed a font using `expo-font` config plugin
- Loading a font using `useFonts` hook at runtime

### Embed a font using `expo-font` config plugin

You can embed a font file in your project using `expo-font` config plugin and use it in your components. Embedding a font this way provides following benefits:

- Available immediately when the app starts on a device
- No additional code required to load fonts in a project asynchronously when the app starts
- Fonts are consistently available across all devices where the app is installed because they're bundled within the app

However, you should be aware of the following limitations:

- Doesn't work on Expo Go since it requires creating a development build
- Only available for SDK 50 and above

To embed a font in a project, follow the steps below:

<Step label="1">

After adding a custom font in your project, install the `expo-font` library.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm expo install expo-font']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Add the config plugin to your [app config](/versions/latest/config/app/) file. The plugin will embed the font in your native project.

The configuration must contain the path to the font file using `fonts` option which takes an array of one or more font files. The path to each font file is relative to the project's root.

For example, in the following configuration, `Inter-Black.otf` font file's path is defined:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-font",
        /* @info The path to the font file is relative to the project's root. */
        {
          "fonts": ["./assets/fonts/Inter-Black.otf"]
        }
        /* @end */
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">

After embedding the font with the config plugin, create a [new development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).

Once the build is created and installed on your device or Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, you can use that font in your project with `fontFamily` style prop.

For example, the `<Text>` uses the `Inter-Black` as the font family:

```tsx
<Text style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter-Black' }}>Inter Black.</Text>
```

</Step>

#### How to determine which font family name to use

On Android, the font family name is the same as of the font file (without the extension). On iOS, the font family name is read from the font file itself.

We recommend naming the font file same as its [PostScript name](#what-is-postscript-name-of-a-font) so the font family name is consistent on both platforms.

<Collapsible summary="What is PostScript name of a font file?">

The **PostScript name** of a font file is a unique identifier assigned to the font that follows Adobe's PostScript standard. It is used by operating systems and apps to refer to the font. It is not a font's **display name**.

For example, Inter Black font file's PostScript name is `Inter-Black`.

<ContentSpotlight src="/static/images/develop/postscript-name.png" />

</Collapsible>

<ConfigReactNative title="Using this method in a bare React Native project?">

- **Android:** Copy font files to **android/app/src/main/assets/fonts**.
- **iOS:** See [Adding a Custom Font to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/text_display_and_fonts/adding_a_custom_font_to_your_app) in the Apple Developer documentation.

</ConfigReactNative>

### Load a font using `useFonts` hook

You can load one or more fonts asynchronously using the `useFonts` from the `expo-font` library. This hook keeps track of the loading state of the font and when an app is initialized, it loads the fonts.

To load a font in a project using `useFonts` hook, follow the steps below:

<Step label="1">

After adding a custom font in your project, install the `expo-font` and `expo-splash-screen` libraries.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm expo install expo-font expo-splash-screen']} />

The `expo-splash-screen` library provides `SplashScreen` component that you can use to prevent rendering the app until the font is loaded and ready.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Map the font using the `useFonts` hook in a top level component such as the root layout (**app/layout.tsx**) file in your project:

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
// Rest of the import statements
/* @info Import <CODE>useFonts</CODE> hook from <CODEexpo-font</CODE>. */ import { useFonts } from 'expo-font'; /* @end */
/* @info Import <CODE>SplashScreen</CODE> so that when the fonts are not loaded, we can continue to show <CODE>SplashScreen</CODE>. */ import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen'; /* @end */
import {useEffect} from 'react';

/* @info This prevents <CODE>SplashScreen</CODE> from auto hiding while the fonts are in loading state. */
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
/* @end */


export default function RootLayout() {
  const [loaded, error] = useFonts({
    'Inter-Black': require('./assets/fonts/Inter-Black.otf'),
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (loaded || error) {
      /* @info After the custom fonts have loaded, we can hide the splash screen and display the app screen. */
      SplashScreen.hideAsync();
      /* @end */
    }
  }, [loaded, error]);

  if (!loaded && !error) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  )
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Use the font on the `<Text>` by using `fontFamily` style prop in a React component:

```tsx
<Text style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter-Black' }}>Inter Black</Text>
```

For a complete yet minimal example how to handle the asynchronous font loading state in the next section.

</Step>

## Use a Google Font

Expo has first-class support for all fonts listed in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). To use one of these, see [`expo-google-fonts`](https://github.com/expo/google-fonts) library. With any of the font package from this library, you can quickly integrate the font and its variants.

For example, to use Inter font, install the [`@expo-google-fonts/inter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo-google-fonts/inter) package with the command below.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-font @expo-google-fonts/inter']} />

To use a Google Font in your project, you can either embed it with the `expo-font` config plugin or use the `useFonts` hook.

### Embed a Google Font using `expo-font` config plugin

You can embed a Google Font in your project using the `expo-font` config plugin and use it in your components.

> **Note:** Embedding a Google Font has same benefits and limitations as embedding a custom font on your own. See the [Embed a custom font using `expo-font` config plugin](#embed-a-font-using-expo-font-config-plugin) section for more information.

To use this approach, you need to [create a new native build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) that includes the font. It is done by passing the path to the desired font file to the `expo-fonts.fonts` option. An example is shown below:

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-font",
      {
        "fonts": ["node_modules/@expo-google-fonts/inter/Inter_100Thin.ttf"]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

If the font you are using includes multiple weights (for example, `Inter_100Thin`, `Inter_700Bold` and so on), you can directly use the font file name for Android. For iOS, use the font and its weight name.

The example below demonstrates how to use `Platform` to select the correct font family name for each platform:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

// Inside a component:
<Text
  style={{
    fontFamily: Platform.select({
      android: 'Inter_100Thin',
      ios: 'Inter-Thin',
    })
  }}>
  Inter Thin
</Text>
```

### `useFonts` hook

Each Google Fonts package provides the `useFonts` hook for convenience. Under the hood, the hook uses [`Font.loadAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/font/#loadasyncfontfamilyorfontmap-source). You do not have to explicitly import the font file since the package itself does that.

<SnackInline label="Using Google fonts" dependencies={['@expo-google-fonts/inter']}>

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { useFonts, Inter_900Black } from '@expo-google-fonts/inter';

export default function App() {
  let [fontsLoaded, fontError] = useFonts({
    Inter_900Black,
  });

  if (!fontsLoaded && !fontError) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter_900Black', fontSize: 40 }}>Inter Black</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});
```

</SnackInline>

## Get a font

The first thing you need is a font file. For a working example, we are going to use Inter Black from the free and open source [Inter font family](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Anderson. A common convention in React Native apps is to put your fonts in a **./assets/fonts** directory. However, you can put them anywhere you like.

### Supported font formats

The two officially supported font formats that work consistently in the Expo SDK across Android, iOS and the web, are OTF and TTF. If your font is in another format, you will be required to set up an [advanced configuration](#beyond-otf-and-ttf) for your project.

If you have both OTF and TTF versions of a font, prefer OTF. OTF is a newer format and **.otf** files are often smaller than **.ttf** files. Sometimes OTF files render slightly better in certain contexts. In general, both formats are very similar and perfectly acceptable.

### Beyond OTF and TTF

If your font is in another format, you have to [customize the Metro bundler configuration](/guides/customizing-metro#adding-more-file-extensions-to-assetexts) to get anything other than OTF and TTF to work. In some cases, trying to render a font format that a platform doesn't support may cause your app to crash.

For reference, the following table provides what formats work on which platforms:

| Format | Web         | iOS         | Android     |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| bdf    | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  |
| dfont  | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  | <YesIcon /> |
| eot    | <YesIcon /> | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  |
| fon    | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  |
| otf    | <YesIcon /> | <YesIcon /> | <YesIcon /> |
| ps     | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  |
| svg    | <YesIcon /> | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  |
| ttc    | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  |
| ttf    | <YesIcon /> | <YesIcon /> | <YesIcon /> |
| woff   | <YesIcon /> | <YesIcon /> | <NoIcon />  |
| woff2  | <YesIcon /> | <YesIcon /> | <NoIcon />  |

## Use a custom font

There are two ways to use a custom font in your project: either embed the font in your native project or load it at runtime. The first approach is recommended as it is simpler and more reliable. The second approach is useful if you want to load the font in Expo Go/without creating a new native build that includes it or loading it from a remote URL.

### Embed font in a native project

> **Note:** The `expo-font` config plugin is only available for SDK 50 and above. If you are using an older SDK, you can [load the font at runtime](#load-the-font-at-runtime) instead.

Install [`expo-font`](/versions/latest/sdk/font/#installation) library and add the config plugin to your [app config](/versions/latest/config/app/) file. The plugin will embed the font in your native project.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-font",
        {
          "fonts": ["./assets/fonts/Inter-Black.otf"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The `fonts` option takes an array of one or more font files to link to the native project. The path to each font file is relative to the project's root.

After [creating a new native build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/), you can use the font in your project with the `fontFamily` style prop. On Android, the font family name will be the name of the font file without the extension. On iOS, the font family name will be read from the font file itself. We recommend naming the font file the same as the **PostScript name** so the family name is consistent on both platforms. For example, if you have a font family named "Inter-Black" and the name of the file **Inter-Black.otf**, then the font family name will be **Inter-Black** on both Android and iOS.

If you want to try a font without creating a new native build, you can load it at runtime. See the next section for details.

### Load font at runtime

After getting the font file, in your project, you need to install [`expo-font`](/versions/latest/sdk/font/#installation) library.

#### Import the font

After the installation step, import the `useFonts` hook from `expo-font` package in your project. The hook keeps track of the loading state of the font. When an app is initialized, the hook loads the map of fonts as shown in the example below:

```jsx App.js
// Rest of the import statements
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';

export default function App() {
  const [fontsLoaded] = useFonts({
    'Inter-Black': require('./assets/fonts/Inter-Black.otf'),
  });
}
```

Then, you can use the font on the `<Text>` by using `fontFamily` style prop.

```jsx
<Text style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter-Black', fontSize: 30 }}>Inter Black</Text>
```

Alternatively, you can use [`Font.loadAsync`](#use-fontloadasync-instead-of-the-usefonts-hook) to load the fonts in your app.

#### Minimal example

Let's take a look at a minimal example that uses Inter font family. It uses [`useFonts` hook](/versions/latest/sdk/font/#usefonts) to import the font from **./assets/fonts** directory.

Inter Black is very bold and dark and pretty distinctive so you should be able to tell if you're able to get the example working right, or if something is wrong. If the platform default font looks a little different for you, that's fine; the platform default font can vary depending on the operating system and the device manufacturer (on Android).

When you load it on your device, you'll see something like this:

<ContentSpotlight src="/static/images/font-example-custom-font.jpg" className="max-w-[305px]" />

To create a new project including this example, run in your terminal:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app --example with-custom-font']} />

> The above example also uses [`expo-splash-screen`](/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/) package. For more information on that, see [Waiting for fonts to load](#wait-for-fonts-to-load) section.

## Platform built-in fonts

If you don't want to use a custom font, you can use the platform's default font by not specifying a font family. Each platform has a different set of fonts available by default, so there's no good way to specify one that will work everywhere without supplying your custom font.

On the web, there are several generic font families that you can specify. Different browsers and operating systems are configured to use different fonts for each of these font family specifications. For example, Safari on an iPhone uses San Francisco as its default for `sans-serif` while Microsoft Edge on Windows uses Arial. Similarly, Chrome on Android uses Roboto, though OnePlus phones often use Slate, and so on.

- `sans-serif`
- `serif`
- `monospace`
- `fantasy`
- `cursive`

In general, your safest bets are just to use the system default which usually is an easy-to-read sans-serif font that the user of any system should be familiar with. However, don't be surprised when the system default font is changed to use another font that is not easy to read but at the same time, is supported on the platform or the device. In this case, use your custom font so you have precise control over what the user will see.

## Use a Google Font

## Wait for fonts to load

If you [embed your fonts in your native project](#embed-font-in-a-native-project), they will be available immediately without any additional code outside the config plugin. However, if you load your fonts at runtime, they will not be available immediately.

It's common to prevent rendering an app until the font is ready. You can accomplish this by displaying the Splash Screen of your app until all fonts have loaded (or an error has been returned). See the [`expo-splash-screen`](/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/) package for more. Additionally, see the [minimal example](#minimal-example) section on how to use it.

### Handle `@expo/vector-icons` initial load

Before `@expo/vector-icons` icons load for the first time, they'll appear as invisible icons in your app. Once they load, they'll be cached for all subsequent uses of the app. To avoid showing invisible icons on your app's first load, you can preload fonts during the initial loading screen with [`useFonts`](/versions/latest/sdk/font/#usefontsmap). For example:

```jsx App.js
useFonts([require('./assets/fonts/ComicSans.ttf', FontAwesome.font)]);
```

## Additional information

### Loading a remote font directly from the web

In general, it's best and safest to load fonts from your local assets. If you submit your app to app stores, the fonts will be bundled with the download and available immediately. You don't have to worry about CORS or other potential issues.

However, if you to load a remote font file directly from the web rather than from your project's assets, you can do it by replacing the `require('./assets/fonts/MyFont.otf')` with the URL of your font. See the below example:

<SnackInline label="Using a remote font" dependencies={['expo-font']}>

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';

export default function App() {
  const [fontsLoaded] = useFonts({
    'Inter-SemiBoldItalic': 'https://rsms.me/inter/font-files/Inter-SemiBoldItalic.otf?v=3.12',
  });

  if (!fontsLoaded) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter-SemiBoldItalic', fontSize: 30 }}>Inter SemiBoldItalic</Text>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 30 }}>Platform Default</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});
```

</SnackInline>

> **warning** **If loading remote fonts, make sure they are being served from an origin with CORS properly configured**. If you don't do this, your remote font might not load properly on the web platform.

### Using `Font.loadAsync` instead of the `useFonts` hook

If you don't want to use the `useFonts` hook (for example, maybe you prefer class components), you can use `Font.loadAsync` directly. Under the hood, the hook uses `Font.loadAsync` from the [`expo-font`](/versions/latest/sdk/font/) library. You can use it directly if you prefer, or if you want to have more fine-grained control over when your fonts are loaded before rendering.

<SnackInline label="Loading font async" dependencies={['expo-font']} files={{
  'assets/fonts/Inter-Black.otf': 'https://snack-code-uploads.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/~asset/44b1541a96341780b29112665c66ac67'

export default class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    fontsLoaded: false,

    await Font.loadAsync(customFonts);
    this.setState({ fontsLoaded: true });
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this._loadFontsAsync();
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.fontsLoaded) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter-Black', fontSize: 30 }}>Inter Black</Text>
