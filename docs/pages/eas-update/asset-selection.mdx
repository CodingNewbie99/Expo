> **info** Available for SDK 50 and above ([`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/) >= 0.23.0).

In SDK 49 and earlier, all assets resolved in the Metro bundler are included in every update and are uploaded to the update server. The new experimental asset selection feature in SDK 50 allows the developer to specify that only certain assets should be included in updates. This can greatly reduce the number of assets that need to be uploaded to and downloaded from the updates server. This feature will work with the EAS Update server or any custom server that complies with the [`expo-updates` protocol](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1).

To use this feature, include the new property `extra.updates.assetPatternsToBeBundled` in your app config. It should define one or more file-matching patterns (regular expressions). For example, suppose your **app.json** file has the patterns defined this way:

```json app.json
  "expo": {
    /* @hide ... your existing configuration */ /* @end */
    "extra": {
      "updates": {
        "assetPatternsToBeBundled": [
          "app/images/**/*.png"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

In this case, all **.png** files in all subdirectories of **app/images** will be included in updates.

If this new property is not in your app config, all assets resolved by the bundler will be included in updates (as per SDK 49 and earlier behavior).

### Ensuring that an update contains all assets needed by your application

When using this feature, assets that do not match any of the file patterns will still resolve in the Metro bundler, but will not be uploaded to the updates server. A developer needs to be certain that assets not included in updates are built into the native build of the app.

If you are building your app locally, or have access to the correct build that you are publishing updates for (with the same **runtimeVersion**), then the **expo-updates** CLI contains a command, **assets:verify**, that will allow you to check whether all required assets will be included when you publish an update:

```bash assets:verify help
$ npx expo-updates assets:verify --help

Description
Verify that all static files in an exported bundle are in either the export or an embedded bundle

Usage
  $ npx expo-updates assets:verify <dir>

  Options
  <dir>                                  Directory of the Expo project. Default: Current working directory
  -a, --asset-map-path <path>            Path to the `assetmap.json` in an export produced by the command `npx expo export --dump-assetmap`
  -e, --exported-manifest-path <path>    Path to the `metadata.json` in an export produced by the command `npx expo export --dump-assetmap`
  -b, --build-manifest-path <path>       Path to the `app.manifest` file created by expo-updates in an Expo application build (either ios or android)
  -p, --platform <platform>              Options: ["android","ios"]
  -h, --help                             Usage info

```

> **info** The CLI command is available for ([`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/) >= 0.24.10).
