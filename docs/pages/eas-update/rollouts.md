EAS Update does not support rollouts. With that said, we built EAS Update with rollouts in mind. We plan to work on rollouts in 2023. With rollouts, you'll be able to incrementally roll out one update over another to a percentage of your end-users.

Stay tuned to our [blog](blog.expo.dev) and to our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/expo) for updates on rollouts.
