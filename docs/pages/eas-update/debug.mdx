This guide shows how to verify our configuration so that we can find the source of problems like an app not showing a published update. It's important to tell the current state of our app at any given time, so we built EAS Update with this in mind. Once we know which updates are running on which builds, we can make changes so that our apps are in the state we expect.

## Go to the Deployments page

The EAS website has a [Deployments page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/deployments) that shows the current state of our app. The term _deployment_ refers to a group of builds and their updates. If we've made builds and updates with EAS, you can see your project's status on the website in the Deployments tab.

## Common problems

The following section describes common problems and how to fix them. Below is a diagram of how EAS Update works and the spots that are useful to inspect when finding the root cause of an issue. In the following sections, we'll inspect and verify these spots and more.

### Unexpected channel

<ImageSpotlight

  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

If the deployment channel is unexpected, it means your build was not built with the correct channel. To fix this, [configure your channel](/#configure-channel).

### Unexpected runtime version

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Deployment has no updates"
  src="/static/images/eas-update/deployments-wrong-runtime.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

If the deployment runtime version is unexpected, it means your build was not built with the correct runtime version. To fix this, [configure your runtime version](/#configure-runtime-version).

### Unexpected branch

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Deployment has no updates"
  src="/static/images/eas-update/deployments-wrong-branch.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

If the deployment has an unexpected branch, you will need to [map your channel to the correct branch](/#map-channel-to-branch).

### Missing updates

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Deployment has no updates"
  src="/static/images/eas-update/deployments-no-updates.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

The displayed deployment does not have any updates. To fix this, [publish an update to the branch](/#publish-update).

### Missing branch

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Deployment has no updates"
  src="/static/images/eas-update/deployments-no-branch.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

The displayed deployment has the correct channel, but it is not linked to a branch. To fix this, [map the channel to the correct branch](/#map-channel-to-branch).

### Missing deployment

If your deployment is not displayed, this means your build is not configured properly with EAS Update. To fix this, [configure your channel](/#configure-channel) and [configure your runtime version](/#configure-runtime-version).

## Solutions

### Configure channel

To verify that a build has a specific channel, make sure that in **eas.json**, there is a channel property:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "channel": "preview"
    },
    "production": {
      "channel": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

Then, we can run a command like `eas build --profile preview` to create a build with a channel named "preview".

### Configure runtime version

To verify your runtime version, make sure your app config (**app.json**/**app.config.js**) has a `runtimeVersion` property:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "runtimeVersion": {
      "policy": "sdkVersion"
    }
  }
}
```

By default, it is `{ "policy": "sdkVersion" }`, but you can change your runtime to [use a different policy or a specific version](/eas-update/runtime-versions).

### Map channel to branch

If the channel is not mapped to the branch we expect, we can change the link with:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# eas channel:edit [channel-name] --branch [branch-name]',
    '',
    '',
    '# Example',
    'eas channel:edit production --branch release-1.0',
  ]}
/>

If your branch is not listed, you can create a new branch with `eas branch:create`

### Publish update

To create and publish an update, we can run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update']} />

After publishing, the output will display the branch and the runtime version. This information can help us verify that we're creating an update with the configuration we expect.

## Mitigation steps

Once we've found the root cause of the issue, there are various mitigation steps we might want to take. One of the most common problems is pushing an update that has a bug inside it. When this happens, we can re-publish a previous update to resolve the issue.

### Re-publishing a previous update

The fastest way to "undo" a bad publish is to re-publish a known good update. Imagine we have a branch with two updates:

```bash
branch: "production"
updates: [
  update 2 (id: xyz2) "fixes typo"     // bad update
  update 1 (id: abc1) "updates color"  // good update
]
```

If "update 2" turned out to be a bad update, we can re-publish "update 1" with a command like this:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# eas update:republish --group [update-group-id]',
    '',
    '# eas update:republish --branch [branch-name]',
    '',
    '',
    '# Example',
    '$ eas update:republish --group abc1',
    '$ eas update:republish --branch production',
  ]}
/>

The example command above would result in a branch that now appears like this:

```bash
branch: "production"
updates: [
  update 3 (id: def3) "updates color"  // re-publish of update 1 (id: abc1)
  update 2 (id: xyz2) "fixes typo"     // bad update
  update 1 (id: abc1) "updates color"  // good update
]
```

Since "update 3" is now the most recent update on the "production" branch, all users who query for an update in the future will receive "update 3" instead of the bad update, "update 2".

While this will prevent all new users from seeing the bad update, users who've already received the bad update will run it until they can download the latest update. Since mobile networks are not always able to download the most recent update, sometimes users may run a bad update for a long time. When viewing error logs for our app, it's normal to see a lingering long tail of errors as our users' apps get the most recent update or build. We'll know we solved the bug when we see the error rate decline dramatically; however, it likely will not disappear completely if we have a diverse user base across many locations and mobile networks.
