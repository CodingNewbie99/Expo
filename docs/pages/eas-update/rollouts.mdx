title: Rollouts

Rollouts allow us to deploy a new branch to a specific channel incrementally. With rollouts, we can roll out Branch B over Branch A by percentage. This is useful when we want to test a new feature to minimize the risk of introducing bugs or other issues to our production environment.

To initiate a rollout, we can use the following command:

```bash
eas channel:rollout [channel]
```

The interactive prompts will guide us through choosing a channel, a branch to begin rolling out, and the percentage of our users to rollout to. To increase or decrease the rollout amount, we can run the `eas channel:rollout [channel]` command again to adjust the rollout percentage.

Once we feel confident in our new branch, or if we want to revert to our original branch, we can end the rollout with the `--end` flag:

```bash
eas channel:rollout [channel] --end
```

Here are a variety of facts that will help us when working with rollouts:
- We can only have one branch rolling out on a channel at once.
- We can see the state of the rollout with `eas channel:view [channel]`.
- When a rollout is in progress, we can still publish updates to both branches, by running `eas update --branch [branch]`, for example.
- We cannot use `eas update --channel [channel]` when a rollout is in progress, since we cannot know which branch to associate the update with.
