Rollouts incrementally deploy updates on a new branch to a specific channel. With rollouts, we can roll out updates from one branch to a percentage of end users and leave the remaining percentage of users on the current branch. This is useful when testing a new feature to minimize the risk of introducing bugs or other issues to our production environment.

To start a rollout, we use `npx eas-cli@latest` or ensure we have version \<TODO\> or above for `eas-cli`. Then we run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['npx eas-cli@latest channel:rollout [channel]']} />

An interactive guide will assist us in selecting a channel, choosing a branch for the rollout, and setting the percentage of users for the rollout. To increase or decrease the rollout amount, we run the command again and choose the `Edit` option to adjust the rollout percentage.

### Ending a rollout

Two methods are available to end a rollout when we choose the `End` option in the interactive guide:

- Republish and revert: This option can be used once we are confident with the update served from our new branch. By choosing this, we'll republish the update onto the old branch and revert users back to it.
- Revert: Disregard the updates on the new branch and return users to the old branch.

### Working with rollouts

- Only one branch can be rolled out on a channel at a single time.
- To see the state of the rollout, we use the `eas channel:rollout [channel]` command.
- When a rollout is in progress, we can publish updates to both branches by running `eas update --branch [branch]`, for example.
- `eas update --channel [channel]` cannot be used when a rollout is in progress, since it cannot know which branch to associate the update with.
