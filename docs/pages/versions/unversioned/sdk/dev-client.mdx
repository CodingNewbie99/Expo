`expo-dev-client` is a library which can be installed in any Expo and React Native project to create a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#development-builds).

A development build is a debug build of your app that provides a flexible, reliable and a complete development environment. `expo-dev-client` provides an extensible in-app development tools UI, launcher UI for that debug build and ability to load project using Expo CLI. These debug builds are also shareable with your team or on multiple devices when working or reviewing that app is in development.

After adding this library, the app's release builds are not affected other than a few header files.

## Installation

<APIInstallSection />

## Configuration in app.json/app.config.js

You can configure development client launcher using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/) if you use config plugins in your project ([EAS Build](/build/introduction) or `npx expo run:[android|ios]`). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect.

<ConfigPluginExample>

  ```json app.json
  {
    "expo": {
      "plugins": [
        [
          "expo-dev-launcher",
          {
            "launchModeExperimental": "most-recent"
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

</ConfigPluginExample>

<ConfigPluginProperties
  properties={[
    {
      name: 'launchModeExperimental',
      description: [
        "Determines whether to launch the most recently opened project or navigate to the launcher screen.",
        "* `'most-recent'` - Attempt to launch directly into a previously opened project and if unable to connect, fall back to the launcher screen.",
        "* `'launcher'` - Opens the launcher screen."
      ].join('\n'),
      default: '"most-recent"',
      experimental: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## API
