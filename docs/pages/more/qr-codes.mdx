qr.expo.dev is a cloud function that generates Expo-branded QR codes. This function creates QR codes for EAS Updates, which are used to preview updates in development builds and Expo Go.

For example, if you and your team have a development build, and you'd like to load the latest update on a specific build's channel, you could go to following endpoint to generate a QR code:

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&runtimeVersion=your-runtime-version&channel=your-channel
```

Which would produce the following QR code SVG:

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="QR code generated by qr.expo.dev"
  src="https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?slug=your-slug&projectId=your-project-id&runtimeVersion=your-runtime-version&channel=your-channel"
  style={{ maxWidth: 200 }}
/>

This QR code represents the following URL:

```text
exp+your-slug://expo-development-client/?url=https://u.expo.dev/your-project-id?runtime-version=your-runtime-version&channel-name=your-channel
```

This URL will deep link into a development build and instruct it to fetch the latest update on the specified channel.

> **info** If sharing the URL is more convenient, you can request the URL directly by adding `format=url` to the query parameters.

## General

The following parameters apply to the /eas-update endpoint.

### Base query parameters

The following are base query parameters that can be included with any request to /eas-update.

| param                    | required | default    | description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slug`                   | no       | exp        | To target Expo Go, use "exp". Otherwise, use `slug` from **app.json** to target a development build. |
| `appScheme` (deprecated) | no       | exp        | Replaced by `slug`. Use `slug` instead.                                                              |
| `host`                   | no       | u.expo.dev | The hostname used in the URL, must be a first-party URL.                                             |
| `format`                 | no       | svg        | Endpoints respond with SVGs by default. To receive a plain text URL, use "url".                      |

### Update by device traits

Preview and production builds make requests to the EAS Update service with `runtimeVersion` and `channel` properties. You can emulate this behavior with the following query parameters:

| param            | required | description                      |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `projectId`      | yes      | The ID of the project            |
| `runtimeVersion` | yes      | The runtime version of the build |
| `channel`        | yes      | The channel name of the build    |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&runtimeVersion=your-runtime-version&channel=your-channel
```

### Update by ID

You can create a QR code for a specific update given its platform-specific ID.

| param      | required | description          |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `updateId` | yes      | The ID of the update |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?updateId=your-update-id
```

### Update by group ID

You can create a QR code for an update group given the update's group ID.

| param       | required | description                |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| `projectId` | yes      | The ID of the project      |
| `groupId`   | yes      | The ID of the update group |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&groupId=your-update-id
```

### Update by branch ID

You can create a QR code with a branch's ID, which will return the latest update available on that branch.

| param       | required | description           |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| `projectId` | yes      | The ID of the project |
| `branchId`  | yes      | The ID of the branch  |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&branchId=your-branch-id
```

### Update by channel ID

You can create a QR code with a channel's ID, which will return the latest update available on the branch or branches that are mapped to that channel.

| param       | required | description           |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| `projectId` | yes      | The ID of the project |
| `channelId` | yes      | The ID of the channel |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&channelId=your-channel-id
```
