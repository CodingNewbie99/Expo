## What is local-first?

> In local-first software, the availability of another computer should never prevent you from working.
> - Martin Kleppmann in ["The past, present, and future of local-first"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMq0vncHJvU)

The term "local-first" was first coined in the paper ["Local-first software"](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/), written by the research lab [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/), but the ideas behind it have been around for a long time. It's the architecture that powers some of our favorite apps, like [Linear](https://linear.app/), [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/), [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), and even [Apple Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)).

### User experience benefits

Local-first software feels **fast** because interactions are no longer network-bound, you can read and write directly from/to a database on your device.

You can trust the software to work offline, and you know that when you are connected to the internet, your data will be seamlessly synced and available on any of your devices running the app.

Another characteristic of local-first software is that it is collaborative - multiple devices can work on the same data, and changes are synced across all of them. This can happen in real-time, like when you collaborate on a design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), or asynchronously, like when you create a task while offline in Linear and it is synced when you are online again.

### Developer experience benefits

You no longer have to manage various states of your app for each network request - "loaded", "loading", "error", etc., with their corresponding UI states and other logic. Write to a local database, and the app will automatically sync the changes to the server. This means that you can focus on building the app, and not worry as much about the networking and offline states.

Your server availability may still be important, but in the event of an outage your users can still access the app and continue working. You may even provide a mechanism to sync the data without going through your server.

### Challenges in building local-first apps

The tools available today are still in their early stages, and so you may find yourself solving problems that you would expect to be solved by the tools you are using today. For example, you may need to implement a custom sync layer, or you may have to figure out how to handle permissions for multiple users operating on the same data. As the ecosystem evolves, we expect it to become easier to build local-first apps.a  If you're not prepared to be an early adopter, and everything that comes with that, you might want to wait for the tools to mature before you start building your app with local-first tools.

## Tools for building local-first apps

A comprehensive list of tools is available on the ["Local-first software" community website](https://localfirstweb.dev/). The following is a shorter list of tools that we at Expo have had direct experience working with.

### SQLite

..add expo-sqlite etc. notes here

### TinyBase

[TinyBase](https://tinybase.org/) calls itself "the reactive data store for local-first apps" - 

### Yjs

[Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) 

...add link to example repo and yjs expo-sqlite adapter

### Automerge

...add notes about this here, also try it out 

### Prisma

[Prisma](https://prisma.io) is well known as the most popular ORM for Node.js and TypeScript backends, and it's now available for Expo and React Native in early access. [Learn more](https://www.prisma.io/blog/bringing-prisma-orm-to-react-native-and-expo).
