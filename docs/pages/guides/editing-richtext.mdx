title: Editing rich text
description: Learn about current approaches to previewing and editing rich text in react-native.
---

A lot of applications need to allow users to type in text. For example, if you want to build a messaging or social media app, you will probably rely heavily on text inputs. React Native has a built-in `<TextInput>` component to implement this without much effort for many simple cases.

Sometimes however, you need to be more flexible. Think of long social media posts, note apps or document editors. Ideally you need to allow different text styles, lists, headings, embedded images and more. This is called a rich text editor, and it’s a difficult problem to solve everywhere, including in React Native.

There’s currently no obvious, default solution for that in the React Native ecosystem, but we can explore some options and promising approaches, each with their own tradeoffs.

# Rendering rich text

If you don’t need to actually edit rich text, just display it, there are a lot of great options:

- If you have markdown content, you can use a markdown renderer like [react-native-markdown-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-markdown-renderer) or other.

- If you have HTML content, you can use [@expo/html-elements](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/html-elements) or simply a webview ([react-native-webview](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webview/)).

- If you have a custom format and want more control, you can take advantage of nesting `<Text>` components to render styles and layouts.

  ```jsx
  <TextInput>
    <Text>
      <Text style={{ fontWeight: 900 }}>Some bold text</Text>Some regular text
    </Text>
  </TextInput>
  ```

- You can also use [Expo Modules](/modules/overview/) to write a custom renderer component with native platform primitives such as `AttributedString` on iOS and 3rd party libraries such as [Markwon](https://github.com/noties/Markwon) on Android.

# Editing rich text

There are a few possible approches to get rich text rendering to work, but all have different limitations.

## Webview-based editors

While most react-native UI components wrap native platform primitives and are fast, performant and “native feeling” as a result, the webview-based rich text editors use a different approach.

They wrap an existing rich text editor built for web with JavaScript inside a [react-native-webview](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webview/). It works on all platforms (Android, iOS, Web) and can take advantage of popular rich text editors available for the Web platform, but has a performance and UX penalty.

You will not be able to use native UI components inside the editor. Any implementation of features like mentions or image embedding will duplicate features and require significant effort to implement.

### Existing webview-based react-native packages

There are a couple of existing react-native packages to allow rich-text editing. These are the easiest option to get started if you just need a basic rich text editor with limited configurability and don’t have strict performance or UX requirements.

Here are some options:

- [react-native-rich-editor](https://github.com/wxik/react-native-rich-editor)
- [react-native-cn-quill](https://github.com/imnapo/react-native-cn-quill)

### Custom webview-based editor

If you need more configurability, you can build a similar package on your own with an existing web only editor, but handle the message passing and web implementation yourself. This gives you all the options your underlying editor offers you and let’s you implement more features.

Here are some options:

- [Quill](https://quilljs.com/)
- [lexical](https://github.com/facebook/lexical)
- [slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate)

You will need to use message passing to pass text and `onChange` events to and from the webview. Since rich texts often end up long, it’s better to model it as an uncontrolled component to prevent lag on each keystroke. Also, if you can avoid serializing and sending the entire state on each keystroke that also improves performance.

## Building on top of React Native TextInput

Let’s discuss if a feature-complete, general purpose rich text input is possible.

React Native allows nested `<Text>` tags, and it even allows them to be used as children of `<TextInput>` to render and edit styled text. It even is synchronous on new react native architecture (the onChange event fires immediately after a new character is typed into the text input field).

Unfortunately, the `<TextInput>` component is built towards working with regular text, and it only returns a string in it’s `onTextChange` callback. This is a significant limitation.

Here’s a quick example. If you are rendering a text input with the following content:

**aa**aa

```jsx
<TextInput>
  <Text>
    <Text style={{ fontWeight: 900 }}>aa</Text>aa
  </Text>
</TextInput>
```

And you append a fifth letter a, the position of your cursor should determine if the new letter is a part of the bold string or not. Unfortunately, the callback only returns `aaaaa`.

There is an additional `onSelectionChange` prop that could be use to get that information, but it makes the task significantly harder. Inserting additional characters (such as newlines for lists or bullet points) also desynchronises the selection.

There are some attempts to build such an editor, such as [markdown-editor](https://github.com/shakogegia/markdown-editor) but no widely used packages exist.

## Markdown editors with always visible styling markers

If you’re ok with using markdown to style text, you can render markdown in a separate, non-editable view while editing. Here’s a package that does that (https://github.com/kunall17/react-native-markdown-editor), but it’s also easy to build on your own using any markdown renderer.

This is an editing experience more suited to power users or programming/tech applications.

You can also explore rendering rich text while showing markdown only in the selected chunk of text or other hybrid approaches.

## Native editors

You can consider using a native Android/iOS rich text editor wrapped into a react-native module. There are a couple of options:

- [react-native-aztec](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/react-native-aztec)
- [gutenberg-mobile](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile)

You can also wrap any native rich text editor using [expo-modules](/modules/overview/), but if you use different ones on each platform you will need to unify their APIs and input formats somehow.

> Rich text is usually represented using [abstract syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).
>
> For example, a bullet list can be a node of type `bulleted-list` with several children of type `list-item`. You can convert both HTML and markdown to a suitable AST format.

There is also an effort to port the lexical editor to iOS and Android and provide a react-native wrapper. You can track it here: https://github.com/facebook/lexical/discussions/2410.

# Summary

While there are a lot of great options for showing rich text, is no one size fits all solution for rich text editing in react-native. In fact, there's even no popular solution that is sufficient in most usecases. Further contribution from the community is needed to improve existing solutions or add new ones.

For now, you need to make a careful choice between a more complex, native editor that offers more features but may be harder to maintain, or an editor built on top of react-native primitives. This depends on how core the feature is to your app, how many features you need in your editor, and how much effort are you willing to spend on building it out.
