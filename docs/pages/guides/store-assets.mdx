Before you can submit your app to the App Store and Play Store, you need to provide screenshots and previews
for your app listing page. The goal of these images and videos is to give prospective users an idea of what your app experience
is going to be like.

It is important to note that while these are called "app screenshots" on both stores and they do have to include accurate
visuals of your app, there is no rule citing that these images have to be screenshots taken on specific devices.
A common approach is to design these assets using a design tool such as Figma and incorporate actual app screenshots
(or designs) with supplementary messaging.
