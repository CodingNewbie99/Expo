Before you can submit your app to the App Store and Play Store, you need to provide screenshots and previews
for your app listing page. The goal of these images and videos is to give prospective users an idea of what your app experience
is going to be like.

It is important to note that while these are called "app screenshots" on both stores and they *do* have to include accurate
visuals of your app, there is no rule citing that these images have to be screenshots taken on specific devices. App and Play Store
give you a required image format and size, but within these restrictions, you can be creative.
For example, a common approach is to design the assets using a design tool such as Figma and incorporate actual app screenshots
(or designs) with supplementary messaging.

## Three approaches for creating Store Assets

There are three commonly used approaches to creating your store assets. You can choose whatever approach works best for your app's needs and resources.

### Option 1: Just screenshots

The most straightforward option: open up your app on a real device and take screenshots.

**Pros**: straightforward to do; most accurate representation of your app

**Cons**: need to load the app on different devices for a full range of screenshots

### Option 2: Screenshots within a design

The majority of apps use this approach: it involves taking screenshots of the app (or in some cases using existing
designs instead of actual screenshots) and embedding them in the store assets along with appropriate messaging.

**Pros:** allows conveying additional messaging withing the assets

**Cons:** the assets need to be created using a design program

### Option 4: Make it fancy

Here you can create parts of your app design to highlight on the store pages, but incorprate them into a design with creative messaging.

**Pros:** you can make your store page really creative and fun

**Cons:** need an experienced designer to create and maintain the assets
