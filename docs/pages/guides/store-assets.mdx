Before you can submit your app to the App Store and Play Store, you need to provide some assets for your store listing page.
The goal of these images and videos is to give prospective users an idea of what your app experience
is going to be like.

The most important assets you need to add are the app screenshots. Note that while they are called "app screenshots" on both stores, and they *do* have to include accurate
visuals of your app, there is no rule citing that these images have to be screenshots taken on specific devices. The stores will have
requirements on image format and size, but within these restrictions, you can be creative.
For example, a common approach is to design the assets using a design tool such as Figma and incorporate actual app screenshots
(or designs) with supplementary messaging.

## Different approaches for creating "screenshots"

There are three commonly used approaches to creating your store screenshots. You can choose whichever approach works best for your app's needs and your resources.

### Option 1: actual screenshots

The most straightforward option: open up your app on a real device and take the screenshots.

**Pros**: straightforward to do; most accurate representation of your app

**Cons**: need to load the app on different devices for a full range of screenshots

### Option 2: screenshots within a design

The majority of apps use this approach: it involves taking screenshots of the app (or in some cases using existing
designs instead of actual screenshots) and embedding them in the store assets along with appropriate messaging.

**Pros:** allows conveying additional messaging within the assets

**Cons:** the assets need to be created using a design program

### Option 3: make it fancy

Here you can use elements of your app design to highlight on the store pages, but incorprate them into a design with creative messaging.

**Pros:** you can make your store page really creative and fun

**Cons:** need an experienced designer to create and maintain the assets

## iOS App Store Asset Requirements

For the iOS App Store you can upload screenshots (images) and previews (videos). For each, Apple requires specific
widths and heights, so make sure you reference the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/screenshot-specifications/)
for the exact sizing. Being even a single pixel off will mean you are unable to submit the images.

See this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5lQcrHYhUZkIxsLYCZa3S6/Store-Asset-Requirements?type=design&node-id=1-43&mode=design&t=eFTsHStO7OY2lLsd-0) for an overview
of the minimum asset requirements for an iOS App.

### Screenshots

At a minimum, Apple requires you to upload 2 screenshots for an iPhone without the notch, and 2 screenshots for the iPhone with the notch,
but you an upload up to 10 screenshots per localisation. Note that if your app is available in multiple languages and your screenshots
include text, you should upload screenshots with the appropriate language for each localisation.

If your app runs on an iPad, you will need to also provide iPad-sized screenshots.

Screenshots can be portrait or landscape.

### Preview (optional)

An app preview is a video you can choose to include to demonstrate how your app works. You can add up to three app previews for each screen size.
Reference the [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-preview-specifications/) for a summary on
video size and format.

## Google Play Store Asset Requirements

Google has specific requirements for the store asset format and dimenstions and they are different from Apple's. For the most up to
date specifications, reference the [official documentation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9866151) for detailed requirements
for your Play Store assets.

See this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5lQcrHYhUZkIxsLYCZa3S6/Store-Asset-Requirements?type=design&node-id=1-171&mode=design&t=YC6s5lYVJiwSQPki-0) for a summary
of the minimum asset requirements for an Android App.

### App Icon

Unlike on the iOS App Store where the app icon is always taken automatically from the app bundle,
on the Google Play store you need to also upload a separate App Icon for your store listing.

### Feature Graphic

A feature graphic must be provided in order to publish your Store Listing. It is a banner that is
displayed at the top of your store listing page.

### Screenshots

You need to upload at least 4 screenshots in order to publish your app.

### Video (optional)

You can add one preview video to your Store Listing. The video needs to be uploaded to YouTube, and you
add it by entering a YouTube URL in the "preview video" field.
