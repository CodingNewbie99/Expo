Keyboard handling is crucial for creating an excellent user experience in your Expo app. This guide covers common keyboard interactions and how to manage them effectively.

React Native provides several keyboard-related APIs, with [`Keyboard`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboard) and [`KeyboardAvoidingView`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview) being the most frequently used. For more complex or custom keyboard interactions, you might consider using [Keyboard Controller](https://kirillzyusko.github.io/react-native-keyboard-controller), which is a library that offers advanced keyboard handling capabilities.

## The basics

### Keyboard avoiding view

The `KeyboardAvoidingView` is a component that automatically adjusts its height, position, or bottom padding based on the keyboard height to remain visible while the keyboard is displayed.

> **info** Android and iOS interact with the `behavior` property differently. On iOS, `padding` is usually what works best, and for Android, just having the `KeyboardAvoidingView` prevents covering the input. This is why the following example uses `undefined` for Android. Playing around with the `behavior` is a good practice since a different option could work best for your app.

```tsx HomeScreen.tsx
import { KeyboardAvoidingView, TextInput } from 'react-native';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  return (
    <KeyboardAvoidingView behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : undefined} style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <TextInput placeholder="Type here..." />
    </KeyboardAvoidingView>;
  );
}
```

In the above example, the height of the `KeyboardAvoidingView` automatically adjusts based on the device's keyboard height, which ensures that the input is always visible.

When using a Bottom Tab navigator on Android, you might notice that focusing on an input field causes the bottom tabs to be pushed above the keyboard. To address this issue, add the `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode` property to your Android configuration in [app confg](/workflow/configuration/) and set it to `pan`.

```json app.json
"expo" {
  "android": {
    "softwareKeyboardLayoutMode": "pan"
  }
}
```

After adding this property, restart the development server and reload your app to apply the changes.

It's also possible to hide the bottom tab when the keyboard opens using [`tabBarHideOnKeyboard`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/#tabbarhideonkeyboard), an option with the Bottom Tab Navigator. If set to `true`, it will hide the bar when the keyboard opens. See the example below.

```tsx _layout.tsx
import { Tabs } from 'expo-router';

export default function TabLayout() {
  return (
    <Tabs
      screenOptions={{
        tabBarHideOnKeyboard: true,
      }}>
      <Tabs.Screen name="index" />
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

### Keyboard events

The `Keyboard` module from React Native allows you to listen for native events, react to them, and make changes to the keyboard, such as dismissing it.

To listen for keyboard events, use the `Keyboard.addListener` method. This method accepts an event name and a callback function as arguments. When the keyboard is shown or hidden, the callback function is called with the event data.

The following example illustrates a use case for adding a keyboard listener. The state variable `isKeyboardVisible` is toggled each time the keyboard shows or hides. Based on this variable, a button that allows the user to dismiss the keyboard only if the keyboard is active is rendered. Also, notice that the button uses the `dismiss` method from the `Keyboard` module.

```tsx HomeScreen.tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Keyboard, View, Button, TextInput } from 'react-native';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const [isKeyboardVisible, setIsKeyboardVisible] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const showSubscription = Keyboard.addListener('keyboardDidShow', handleKeyboardShow);
    const hideSubscription = Keyboard.addListener('keyboardDidHide', handleKeyboardHide);

    return () => {
      showSubscription.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  const handleKeyboardShow = event => {
    setIsKeyboardVisible(true);
  };

  const handleKeyboardHide = event => {
    setIsKeyboardVisible(false);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {isKeyboardVisible && <Button title="Dismiss keyboard" onPress={Keyboard.dismiss} />}
      <TextInput placeholder="Type here..." />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Advanced keyboard handling

For more complex keyboard interactions, such as larger scrollable entry forms with several text input fields, consider using the [Keyboard Controller](https://kirillzyusko.github.io/react-native-keyboard-controller) library. It offers additional functionality beyond the built-in React Native keyboard APIs, providing consistency across Android and iOS with minimal configuration and offering the native feel users expect.

### Prerequisites

The following steps are described using a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) since this library is not included in Expo Go. See [Create a development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) for more information.

[Keyboard Controller](https://kirillzyusko.github.io/react-native-keyboard-controller) requires `react-native-reanimated` to work correctly. To install it, follow the [installation instructions](/versions/latest/sdk/reanimated/#installation).

### Install keyboard controller

To get started with [Keyboard Controller](https://kirillzyusko.github.io/react-native-keyboard-controller), install it in your Expo project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install react-native-keyboard-controller']} />

Then prebuild your app:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo prebuild --clean']} />

### Set up Keyboard Controller provider

To finalize the setup, add the `KeyboardProvider` to your app.

```tsx _layout.tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import { KeyboardProvider } from 'react-native-keyboard-controller';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <KeyboardProvider>
      <Stack>
        <Stack.Screen name="home" />
        <Stack.Screen name="chat" />
      </Stack>
    </KeyboardProvider>
  );
}
```

### Animating Views in Sync with Keyboard Height

The `KeyboardAvoidingView` component is excellent for prototyping but requires platform-specific configuration and is not very customizable. Here's how to achieve the same functionality using [Keyboard Controller](https://kirillzyusko.github.io/react-native-keyboard-controller).

Let's use the `useKeyboardHandler` hook from [Keyboard Controller](https://kirillzyusko.github.io/react-native-keyboard-controller), which provides access to keyboard lifecycle events and allows us to determine when the keyboard starts animating and its position in every frame of the animation.
The example below is a hook that leverages the `useKeyboardHandler` hook to access the height of the keyboard at each frame, using `useSharedValue` from reanimated returns the height.

```tsx ChatScreen.tsx
import { useKeyboardHandler } from 'react-native-keyboard-controller';
import Animated, { useAnimatedStyle, useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';

const useGradualAnimation = () => {
  const height = useSharedValue(0);

  useKeyboardHandler(
    {
      onMove: e => {
        'worklet';
        height.value = Math.max(e.height, 0);
      },
    },
    []
  );
  return { height };
};
```

The following example uses the `useGradualAnimation` hook to animate a view and give it a smooth animation when the keyboard is active or dismissed.

The component gets the keyboard height using the `useGradualAnimation` hook. It then creates an animated style called `fakeView` using the `useAnimatedStyle` hook from reanimated. This style only contains one property, `height` which is set to the keyboard's height.

The `fakeView` animated style is used in an animated view after the text input. This view height will animate based on the keyboard's height at each frame, effectively pushing the content above the keyboard with a smooth animation. It also decreases its height to zero when the keyboard is dismissed.

```tsx ChatScreen.tsx
import { StyleSheet, Platform, FlatList, View, StatusBar, TextInput } from "react-native";
import Animated, { useAnimatedStyle, useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";
import { useKeyboardHandler } from "react-native-keyboard-controller";

import MessageItem from "@/components/MessageItem";
import { messages } from "@/messages";

const useGradualAnimation = () => {...};

export default function ChatScreen() {
  const { height } = useGradualAnimation();

  const fakeView = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    return {
      height: Math.abs(height.value),
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        data={messages}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <MessageItem message={item} />}
        keyExtractor={item => item.createdAt.toString()}
        contentContainerStyle={styles.listStyle}
      />
      <TextInput placeholder="Type a message..." style={styles.textInput} />
      <Animated.View style={fakeView} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    paddingTop: Platform.OS === "android" ? StatusBar.currentHeight : 0,
  },
  listStyle: {
    padding: 16,
    gap: 16,
  },
  textInput: {
    width: "95%",
    height: 45,
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderRadius: 8,
    borderColor: "#d8d8d8",
    backgroundColor: "#fff",
    padding: 8,
    alignSelf: "center",
    marginBottom: 8,
  },
});
```

### Handling multiple inputs

For screens with multiple inputs, the Keyboard Controller provides `KeyboardAwareScrollView` and `KeyboardToolbar` components. These components handle input navigation and prevent the keyboard from covering the screen without custom configuration:

```tsx FormScreen.tsx
import { TextInput, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { KeyboardAwareScrollView, KeyboardToolbar } from 'react-native-keyboard-controller';

export default function FormScreen() {
  return (
    <>
      <KeyboardAwareScrollView bottomOffset={62} contentContainerStyle={styles.container}>
        <View>
          <TextInput placeholder="Type a message..." style={styles.textInput} />
          <TextInput placeholder="Type a message..." style={styles.textInput} />
        </View>
        <TextInput placeholder="Type a message..." style={styles.textInput} />
        <View>
          <TextInput placeholder="Type a message..." style={styles.textInput} />
          <TextInput placeholder="Type a message..." style={styles.textInput} />
          <TextInput placeholder="Type a message..." style={styles.textInput} />
        </View>
        <TextInput placeholder="Type a message..." style={styles.textInput} />
      </KeyboardAwareScrollView>
      <KeyboardToolbar />
    </>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    gap: 16,
    padding: 16,
  },
  listStyle: {
    padding: 16,
    gap: 16,
  },
  textInput: {
    width: 'auto',
    flexGrow: 1,
    flexShrink: 1,
    height: 45,
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderRadius: 8,
    borderColor: '#d8d8d8',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    padding: 8,
    marginBottom: 8,
  },
});
```

The above example wraps the inputs with `KeyboardAwareScrollView` to prevent the keyboard from covering them. The `KeyboardToolbar` component displays navigation controls and a dismiss button. While it works without configuration, you can customize the toolbar content if needed.
