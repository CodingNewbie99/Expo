Analytics in your app allow you to measure how users behave when they use your app and make informed decisions. It is done using an Analytics provider that enables you to track common events and define your own custom events. After collecting data, you can analyze your users' interactions with the app. It can be a key to providing a better user experience.

The following list provides common analytics providers that are available in the Expo and React Native ecosystem.
