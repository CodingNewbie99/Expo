In-app purchases (IAP) are transactions within a mobile or desktop application where users can buy digital goods or additional features. This guide provides a list of popular libraries and tutorials for implementing IAP in your Expo app.

> In-app purchase libraries require configuring custom native code. Native code is not configurable when using Expo Go. Instead, create a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/), which allows using a native library in your project.
