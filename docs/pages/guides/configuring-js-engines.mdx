JavaScript engines are responsible for executing your application code and providing various features like memory management, optimization, and error handling. Expo projects, by default, use [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) as the JavaScript engine (in SDK 47 and lower, the default was JSC). It is also possible to switch to other engines like JSC or V8 for both Android and iOS platforms, but not for web because the JavaScript engine is included in the web browser.

### Configuring the `jsEngine` through Expo config

We recommend Hermes because it is purpose built and optimized for React Native apps, and it has the best debugging experience. If you are familiar with the tradeoffs of different JavaScript engines and would like to change away from Hermes, the `jsEngine` field inside **app.json** allows you to specify the JavaScript engine for your app.

The default value is `hermes`. If you would like to use [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) instead, set the `jsEngine` field in your **app.json**:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "jsEngine": "jsc"
  }
}
```

<Collapsible summary="Are you using the bare workflow?">

To change the JavaScript engine in a bare React Native project, update the `expo.jsEngine` value in **ios/Podfile.properties.json** and **android/gradle.properties**

</Collapsible>

It's important to highlight that changing the JS engine will require you to recompile development builds with `eas build` to work properly.

### Using the V8 Engine

To use the V8 engine, you need to install [react-native-v8](https://github.com/Kudo/react-native-v8), an opt-in package that adds V8 runtime support for React Native. You can install it by running the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install react-native-v8 v8-android-jit']} />

Make sure to remove the `jsEngine` field from **app.json**

You can run `expo prebuild -p android --clean` after the installation to prebuild again.

### Switch JavaScript engine on a specific platform

You may want to use a different engine on one specific platform, one way to do this is to set one `"jsEngine"` value at the top level and then override it with a different value under the `"android"`/`"ios"` key.

```js
{
  "expo": {
    "jsEngine": "hermes",
    "ios": {
      /* @info jsEngine inside platform section will take precedence over the common field */
      "jsEngine": "jsc"
    /* @end */
    }
  }
}
```
