To build your project into an app locally using your machine, you have to manually generate native code before you can test the debug build or create a production build for it to submit to the app store. There are two ways you can build your app locally. This guide provides a brief introduction to both methods and references to other guides that are necessary to create this workflow.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps described in this guide, you need the following installed on your local machine:

- [Android Studio](/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to build for Android
- [Xcode](/workflow/ios-simulator/) on macOS to build for iOS

## Local app compilation

To build your project locally you can use compile commands from Expo CLI which generates the **android** and **ios** directories:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Build native Android project',
    '$ npx expo run:android',
    '# Build native iOS project',
    '$ npx expo run:iOS',
  ]}
/>

The above commands compile your project into an app locally. You can also add the `--device` flag to create a debug build of your project and run it on a connected device. These compilation commands initially run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native directories (**android** and **ios**) before building.

After building your project for the first time you can make modifications to your project's configuration or native code. However, it is recommended to make these modifications using [app config](/workflow/configuration/) or by creating a [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/).

Generating native directories will help with the app development in scenarios where you need to add custom native code to your app.

To learn more about how compilation and prebuild works, see the following guides:

## Local builds with EAS

You can run the same build process that EAS Build uses locally on your machine with the `--local` flag.
