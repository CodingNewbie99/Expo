We believe Expo tools are a great option for anyone looking to create amazing cross-platform apps quickly. Nonetheless, everyone's project is unique, and there may be reasons Expo is not the right choice for what you're building. Read on for some reasons why you may _not_ want to use Expo tools.

## Expo Application Services

**With the release of Expo Application Services (EAS)**, building your app with Expo has far fewer limitations, and it can be used for any project, no matter the complexity. With [EAS Build](/build/setup):

<Collapsible summary="All libraries available to React Native apps are available in Expo">

All libraries available to React Native apps are available in Expo projects. Some libraries may require a [Prebuild Config Plugin](/guides/config-plugins/) to be added. The addition of config plugins means:

- Any third-party push notification service, such as OneSignal, is supported.
- Native libraries that integrate with proprietary services or require configuring native code are supported.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="App size can be as small as you want">

Apps built with EAS Build can be as small as you want in size since [the entire Expo SDK is no longer bundled](https://expo.fyi/managed-app-size#app-size-with-eas-build) by default.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Native dependencies can be customized to target children under a particular age">

Both [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids) and [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9285070?hl=en) provide strict guidelines for any apps that specifically target children under the age of 13.

Apps built with EAS Build [include only your app's explicit native dependencies](https://blog.expo.dev/expo-managed-workflow-in-2021-d1c9b68aa10). See [Development builds](/build/introduction/) for more information on how to use it.

</Collapsible>

EAS Build is a new service and we plan to address many of the current limitations in time. See [EAS Build Limitations](/build-reference/limitations/) for more information on what are the current limitations.

## Expo Go and the classic `expo build` system

> [The classic build service is sunset and will only run until 2023](https://blog.expo.dev/turtle-goes-out-to-sea-d334db2a6b60).

If you're still using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`, or using Expo Go for development, it's important to be aware of the limitations of those features.

[Expo Go](/workflow/expo-go/) comes with a pre-configured set of libraries known as the Expo SDK. This makes development much faster and makes the mobile development experience much closer to the web development experience. However, additional native code cannot be added to Expo Go on the fly, so you are limited in terms of what dependencies you can add. This also applies to apps built with `expo build:android` and `expo build:ios`.

The following limitations only apply when you are using Expo Go for development with the classic build system. **If you are using [Development builds or EAS Build](#eas), the following limitations do not apply.**

<Collapsible summary="Not all Android and iOS APIs are supported">

Many [device APIs](/versions/latest/) are supported in Expo SDK. If any of the APIs you need is not supported, you can either use [EAS Build](/build/setup) or [Development builds](/development/introduction/) or follow [our blog](https://blog.expo.dev) to see the release notes for our SDK updates. Feature prioritization isn't strictly based on popular vote, but it certainly helps us to gauge what is important to users.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Classic build are not a best choice to keep your app size extremely lean">

The size for an app built with `expo build` on Android is about 15MB and on iOS is approximately 20MB (download). This is because some APIs are included regardless of whether or not you are using them &mdash; this lets you publish updates that use new APIs but comes at the cost of binary size.

Some of the included APIs are tied to services you may not be using. For example, the Facebook Mobile SDK is included to support Facebook Login and Facebook Ads, along with the Google Mobile SDK, for similar reasons.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Native libraries to integrate with proprietary services are not included in Expo Go">

Related to the previous point, we typically avoid adding native modules to the Expo Go if they are tied to external, proprietary services. We can't add something to the SDK just because a few users need it for their app. We have to think of a broader base of users.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Free builds can sometimes be queued">

You can easily build your app for submission to stores without even installing Xcode or Android Studio by using the free [standalone build service](/archive/classic-updates/building-standalone-apps), but it occasionally has a queue depending on how many other folks are building a binary at that time.

You can have access to dedicated build infrastructure with a ["Priority" plan](https://expo.dev/eas), or you can [run the builds on your own CI](/classic/turtle-cli) if you prefer.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Your app cannot target children under 13 years old without customizing native dependencies">

Apps built with `expo build:ios|android` contain code for the entire Expo SDK. Unfortunately, you cannot customize the native dependencies, including Facebook's Audience Network library. So if you build your app this way, you cannot designate it as "designed primarily for children under 13" in the app stores, even though this code is never run unless you explicitly call it.

</Collapsible>

## Bare workflow

> If you'd like to continue getting the same development experience that you have with Expo Go, but also use custom native libraries or custom native code, you should check out the [Development builds]()

As similar to [Development builds], bare workflow also provides access to the underlying native projects and any native code. It's a "bare" native project where developers make direct changes to their native `android` and `ios` project directories rather than continuously generating them on demand using the [Expo config (**app.json**) and prebuild](/workflow/prebuild/).

The following list is specifically oriented towards the limitations that exist around using Expo tools and services in the bare workflow.

<Collapsible summary={<span><span className="strike">Build service only works in the managed workflow</span> (Resolved in December 2020)</span>}>



</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Configuration must be done on each native project rather than once with Expo config">

Configuring app icons, launch screen, and so on must be configured in the native projects for each platform using the standard native tooling rather than in one place via **app.json** or **app.config.js**.
