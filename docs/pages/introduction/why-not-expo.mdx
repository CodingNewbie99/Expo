We believe Expo tools are a great option for anyone looking to create amazing cross-platform apps quickly. Nonetheless, everyone's project is unique, and there may be reasons Expo is not the right choice for what you're building. Read on for some reasons why you may _not_ want to use Expo tools.

## EAS

For more information on what current limitations exist with EAS, see the following:

### Bare workflow

Similar to [Development builds](/development/introduction), bare workflow also provides access to the underlying native projects and any native code. It's a "bare" native project where you can make direct changes to the project's native **android/** and **ios/** directories rather than continuously generating them on demand using the [Expo config and prebuild](/workflow/prebuild/).

EAS Build works with bare workflow projects if you check in the native directories but prebuild can no longer sync changes from the Expo config to the native directories. You'll have to configure the native directories on your own with native tools such as Android Studio or Xcode.

## Expo Go

[Expo Go](/workflow/expo-go) provides a quick way to get started with your app development. It comes with a pre-configured set of libraries known as the Expo SDK. This makes development much faster and makes the mobile development experience much closer to the web development experience.

Like any other tool, it too has its own limitations:

- Using a third-party library that requires native code
- Using a third-party push notification service

**All of the above have been addressed with EAS Build which is compatible with all type of React Native projects. If you come across them, you can transition your project to use [development builds](/development/introduction/).**

## Up next

> We are either actively working on or planning to build solutions to all of the limitations listed above, and if you think anything is missing, please bring it to our attention by posting to our [feature requests board](https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests) or the [forums](https://forums.expo.dev/).
