To help you build an accurate mental model, this document provides an overview of the development process of building an Expo app.

You might have used Expo or React Native before or are using them for a while, or you are still learning about the ecosystem. This document starts by clarifying key concepts and then defines different parts of the core development loop.

## Key concepts

<Collapsible summary={`What is an "Expo app"?`}>

This is a shorthand term we use for describing a React Native app that uses Expo tools. It can use a single package from the Expo SDK, or Expo Router, or Expo CLI, or Continuous Native Generation, or a combination of them.

We say "Expo app" because _React Native app that uses Expo tools_ is incredibly inconvenient to frequently type and speak out loud.

<Collapsible summary={<>Is the development process different for an "Expo app" and a "React Native app that does <span><i>not</i></span> use Expo tools"?</>}>

All of the options of a "React Native app that does not use Expo tools" are available to you in an Expo app and much more. Expo provides a variety of tools and services that can be adopted independently, so the answer depends on what you choose to use!

</Collapsible>

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary={`What is the difference between "Expo" and "Expo Application Services (EAS)"?`}>

Expo is an open-source project that gives developers powerful tools to assist in building and maintaining React Native apps at any scale. For example, Expo CLI, Expo Router, and Expo SDK packages. All Expo open-source tools are entirely free to use and carry the MIT license.

Expo Application Services (EAS) is an optional suite of hosted services that make it simple to:

- Build, submit, and update your app
- Set up automation around all of these processes
- Collaborate with your team

EAS solves a set of problems that require physical resources, such as application servers and CDNs for serving over-the-air updates and physical servers for running builds. EAS has a generous [free plan](https://expo.dev/pricing#get-started) that will work for many student and hobby projects.

<Collapsible summary="Do I have to use EAS if I use Expo open source tools?">

Nope! Your Expo project is just a React Native app, which is just a native app. You can use Fastlane or any native build, update, and more, tools you like.

Most EAS services also allow you to run them on your own infrastructure, and we provide instructions for how you can accomplish this. For example, [self-hosting updates](/distribution/custom-updates-server/) (rather than using EAS Update), or [running builds locally](/guides/local-app-development/) or on [your own CI](build/building-on-ci/) (rather than using our EAS Build worker fleet).

For most teams, it makes sense to use EAS rather than spending the engineering time and resources on acquiring, setting up, and maintaining the services on other infrastructure. Additionally, EAS provides deep integration between services, such as the deployments page for monitoring app version adoption, assigning updates to specific builds, and rolling those updates out incrementally &mdash; which ties back into monitoring with [EAS Insights](/eas-insights/introduction/).

<Collapsible summary={`Expo Go: an optional tool for learning, experimenting, and prototyping`}>

There's no faster way to spin up a React Native project and run it on your device or emulator than Expo Go ([learn more](/get-started/expo-go/)), especially when combined with [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/).

However, Expo Go and Snack are not intended for building production apps. They are great when you're getting started on a project or for prototypes. If you plan on deploying your app to the store, then [development builds](#development-builds) will provide a more flexible, reliable, and complete development environment. **This guide does not go into any detail about Expo Go, and this is the only section that mentions it.**

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Development builds">

A development build is a debug build of your app that contains `expo-dev-client` library. It helps you iterate as quickly as possible and provides a more flexible, reliable, and complete development environment than Expo Go. You can install any native library and configure or apply changes to a native directory using [app config](/workflow/configuration/) or by creating a [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/). You can create a [development build locally](/guides/local-app-development/#local-builds-with-expo-dev-client) or [EAS](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) to create a build in the cloud.

<Collapsible summary={`Android and iOS native projects`}>

React Native apps for mobile platforms are made of two interconnected parts:

<Collapsible summary={`1. The app JavaScript`}>

This contains your React components and most, if not all, of your application logic. It has more or less the same role as the app JavaScript on React websites.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary={`2. The native projects`}>

Android and Xcode projects that bundle the JavaScript app, serve as the launchpad for the JavaScript app on each platform. They also handle the rendering of native components and provide the means to access platform-specific functionalities and integrate with any installed native libraries. App configuration, such as the name (as it appears on the home screen), icon, required permissions, associated domains, supported orientations, and so on, is configured in the native project.

</Collapsible>

Like any mobile app, the application that is distributed to users is created by compiling ("building") the Android Studio or Xcode project.

When you initialize a new app with `npx create-expo-app`, you will not see any **android** or **ios** directories. You can [generate the native projects by running `npx expo prebuild`](/workflow/prebuild/), which will initialize the native projects and then apply the project Expo app config (**app.json/app.config.js**) to them.

If you use a cloud-based development workflow, you may never need to run prebuild or install Android Studio or Xcode on your own machine (although you may find this useful). This is explained below in the [Local and cloud-based development workflows](#local-and-cloud-based-development-workflows).

<Collapsible summary={`Why aren't the native projects created by default when you initialize a project with create-expo-app?`}>

The default behavior encourages the use of [Continuous Native Generation](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) (CNG) to generate the native projects when needed, which can make upgrades and project maintenance significantly easier.
The following three commands result in more or less the same project:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    'npx create-expo-app MyApp && cd MyApp && npx expo prebuild',
    '',
    'npx create-expo-app --template bare-minimum',
    '',
    'npx react-native init MyApp && cd MyApp && npx install-expo-modules',
  ]}
/>

</Collapsible>

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary={`Continuous Native Generation (CNG)`}>

You can add the native project directories (**android** and **ios**) to your **.gitignore** and/or delete the project at any time, then re-generate them from the Expo app config with `npx expo prebuild` whenever required. This is known as Continuous Native Generation.

Using CNG can make upgrading to new versions of React Native much easier. It can simplify project maintenance and facilitate setting up complex features such as [App Clips](https://github.com/bndkt/react-native-app-clip), [share extensions](https://github.com/timedtext/expo-config-plugin-ios-share-extension), and [push notifications](https://github.com/OneSignal/onesignal-expo-plugin). Learn more about [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/).

<Collapsible summary="What if I want to edit the native project configuration in Android Studio or Xcode rather than generating the projects with prebuild?">

Apart from generating your project with the `npx expo prebuild` command, you can also initialize your project with `npx create-expo-app --template bare-minimum`. This already runs the prebuild command when initializing your Expo project.

After the native project directories are created and added to your project you may want to configure them directly instead of using Expo app config. If you decide to do so, then you lose the ability to generate those directories again with the prebuild command. Doing so will delete all the direct modifications you made to those native directories since the prebuild command will override those changes. You also become responsible for maintaining the native projects and keeping them up to date.

CNG has proven to be helpful to many teams. However, it may not be the best fit for your project and this is a legitimate way to use Expo tools.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="How do I know when I need to run prebuild again?">

If you add a new native dependency to your project or change the project configuration in Expo app config (**app.json/app.config.js**), you can run `npx expo prebuild` to re-generate the native project directories.

<Collapsible summary="Cloud-based and local development workflows">

It's possible with Expo and EAS to work on your native Android or iOS app without installing Android Studio or Xcode and creating a cloud-based development build. This can be helpful when you:

- are limited by local machine development workflow (for example, Xcode for iOS is [exclusively available for macOS](/faq/#can-i-develop-ios-apps-on-a-windows-computer))
- Want Use [`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-expo-dev-client) library to extend your development build by providing a launch UI to preview your updates, switch between development servers without the need to rebuild the entire app binary, share and run the build on any machine, and more
- Iterate as quickly as possible when developing your app
- Share your project with other collaborators or trusted testers
- Keep up with the latest changes in the React Native ecosystem and easier app upgrades
- Use a proven and dedicated path for going from development to production using the EAS services (Build, Update, Submit)

<Collapsible summary="Do you want to compile your app locally">

To compile and release your app locally, you can use your own machine. You have to manually generate native code before testing the debug build or creating a production build for it to submit to the app store. You also need tools such as Android Studio and Xcode installed on your machine.

See [Local app compilation](/guides/local-app-development/#local-app-compilation) for more in-depth information on how to set up your local development environment and compile your app locally. You can also use [`expo-dev-client` library](/guides/local-app-development/#local-builds-with-expo-dev-client) when managing everything locally.

</Collapsible>

Choosing a cloud-based or local development workflow isn't a commitment. It's a choice you make each time you run a new native build. Whether you choose cloud-based or local doesn't significantly alter your development loop. It's about how you produce and distribute your app binaries that your JavaScript code runs against.

</Collapsible>

## Initialize and run a project

The easiest way to [create a new project is with `create-expo-app`](/get-started/create-a-project/#initialize-a-new-project). After creating your project, you can immediately launch it directly in Expo Go on your physical device or in an emulator/simulator if you want to experiment or build a quick prototype.

In most cases, you will create and use a development build of your project. You will install the [`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-expo-dev-client) library. Development builds can be created with EAS Build or locally on your machine:

## The core development loop

The core development loop described in the diagram above is a cycle of four main activities that you typically go through when developing an app.

- **Write and run JavaScript code**: This involves creating components, writing business logic, or installing third-party libraries from npm that don't require native code changes. The changes you make here are reflected in your app without needing any interaction with the native side of your app.

- **Update app configuration**: This involves modifying your app's configuration using the app config file (**app.json** or **app.config.js**). It includes updating your app's name, icon, splash screen, and other properties. These changes don't affect the native project directly. However, if you make changes that affect the native projects, you can use the [app config](/workflow/configuration/) to modify the native project configuration or create or use a [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/). See [app config reference](/versions/latest/config/app/) for a complete list of properties available in the app config file.

- **Write native code or modify native project configuration**: This includes writing native code directly or modifying native code configuration. You need access to the native code project directories to make these changes. You can create a development build using EAS or locally.

- **Install a third-party library that requires native code modifications**: This includes that a third-party library requires making changes to the native code project configuration. Either the library provides a config plugin or steps to take to update the app config. Like the previous activity, this also requires you to create a development build.

When creating a [development build](#development-builds), you have two options. You can create a cloud-based build using [EAS Build](/build/setup/) or do it locally. If you choose to do it locally, you can use [CNG](#continuous-native-generation-cng) and then [`npx expo prebuild --clean`](#how-do-i-know-when-i-need), or you can create a development build using [`npx expo run android|ios` or Android Studio and Xcode](/guides/local-app-development/#local-app-compilation).

> **Note**: When creating a development build locally, the `npx expo run` commands will generate native directories before building your app. If you modify your project's configuration or native code after the first build, you will have to rebuild your project. Running `npx expo prebuild` again layers the changes on the top of existing files. It may also produce different results after the build. To avoid this, add native directories to the project's **.gitignore** and use `npx expo prebuild --clean` command.

During your app's development loop can also [install different variants (development, preview or production)](/build-reference/variants/) of your app on the same device.

Another key part of the development loop is to debug issues. See [Debugging runtime issues](/debugging/runtime-issues/) for more information about debugging your app and learn about different [debugging tools](/debugging/tools/) available.

## Share app with testers

The next step to developing an app is to share your app with your team, with beta testers, or run it on multiple test devices. A traditional approach is to upload your app's binary to the Google Play Beta (Android) or TestFlight (iOS). This can be a time-consuming effort and is limited to only one active build at a time (for example, in the case of TestFlight).

If you are using EAS Build, we recommend going through [Internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution/) to learn more about sharing your app for testing.

If you compile your app locally, you can create [release builds locally](/deploy/build-project/#production-builds-locally).

## Release app to stores

To release your app on the app stores, you can use [EAS Submit](/submit/introduction/). For more information on using EAS Submit, see [Submit to Google Play Store](/submit/android/) and [Submit to Apple App Store](/submit/ios/).

To create a release build locally, see [release builds locally](/deploy/build-project/#production-builds-locally) and then go through the app stores guide to submit your app.

## Monitor app in production

Two ways to monitor your production app are crash reports and analytics. Crash reports help you learn about exceptions or errors that your users run into while using your app. You can use [Sentry](/guides/using-sentry/) or [BugSnag](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/react-native/expo/) to enable crash reports.

Analytics allows you to track how users interact with your app. See [analytics overview](/guides/using-analytics/) to learn more about the services available in the Expo and React Native ecosystem.

## Update the app

The `expo-updates` library allows you to programmatically make new instant updates available to your production app. Sending instant updates is helpful for fixing bugs or updating your app's JavaScript.

You can use [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/) which provides first-class support for instant updates in a React Native app. It serves updates from the edge of a global CDN and uses modern networking protocols such as HTTP/3 for clients that support them. It is also [tailored for developers](/eas-update/develop-faster/) who use EAS Build. You can also use it for builds you have created [locally](/eas-update/build-locally/).
