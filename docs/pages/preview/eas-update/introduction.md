**EAS Update** is a hosted service that serves updates for projects using the `expo-updates` library.

EAS Update makes fixing small bugs and pushing quick fixes a snap in between app store submissions. It accomplishes this by allowing an end-user's app to swap out the non-native parts of their app (for example, JS, styling, and image changes) with a new update that contains bug fixes and other updates.

All projects that contain the `expo-updates` library are able to receive updates. To start using EAS Update, get started with the docs below:
