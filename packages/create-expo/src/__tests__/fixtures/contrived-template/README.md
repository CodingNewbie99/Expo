This fixture provides a contrived example template, mostly to help with verifying that [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/tree/master) will resolve different files based on the rename config passed to it.

It doesn't matter whether the contents of the files are genuine - the only important thing is to ensure the string `HelloWorld` (or `com.helloworld`, in Android files) is inside them, to test matching behavior.
