# expo-splash-screen

`expo-splash-screen` customizes the splash screen that is shown on application launch. A splash screen is what users see when the app is launched, before it has loaded. Splash screens (sometimes called launch screens) provide a user's first experience with your application.

## üöÄ Features

### Build-in splash screen image resize modes

`expo-splash-screen` is shipped with built-in feature for taking care of proper displaying your splash screen image. You can use following resize modes to obtain behavior as if using React Native `<Image>` component's resizeMode style.

#### `CONTAIN` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

| Android                                                   | iOS                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xu9vvDA.gif" width="200" /> | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xu9vvDA.gif" width="200" />  |

#### `COVER` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

| Android                                                   | iOS                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDkINlr.gif" width="200" /> | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDkINlr.gif" width="200" />  |

#### `NATIVE` resize mode

Android only.
Using this resize mode your app will be leveraging Android's ability to present a static bitmap while the application is starting up. Android (unlike iOS) does not support stretching the provided image during launching, so the application will present the given image centered on the screen.

| Android                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|

Selecting this resize mode requires some more work to be done in native configuration.
Please take a look at [`res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#res/drawable/splashscreen.xml) section and [`res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png`](#res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png) section.

## üìö API

```tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
```

The native splash screen that is controlled via this modules autohides once ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is mounted. That means that upon first `render` of you application that returns any renderable view component native splash screen will hide. This default behavior can be prevented by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync) and later on [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscree.hideasync). 

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`

Makes the native splash screen stay visible until [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscree.hideasync) is called. This method must be called before any ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is rendered (either in global scope of your main component or when component renders `null` at the beginning - see [Examples section](#examples)).

Preventing default autohiding might come in handy if your application needs to prepare/download some resources and/or make some API calls before first `render` returning some actual view hierarchy with data can be made.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves when preventing autohiding makes sense.
`Promise` rejection most likely means that native splash screen cannot be prevented from autohiding (it's already hidden at the moment of calling this method or the splash screen is already prevented from autohiding (subsequent call to this method)).

### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`

Hides the native splash screen. Works only if native splash screen has been previously prevented from autohiding by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync) method.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves when `hideAsync` call makes any sense.
`Promise` rejections most likely means that native splash screen is already hidden (either by previously called `hideAsync` or not calling `preventAutoHideAsync` in the first place).

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Examples

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in global scope  

`App.tsx`
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

// Prevent native splash screen from autohiding before App component declaration
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()
  .then(() => console.log('SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() succeeded'))
  .catch(console.warn); // it's good to catch and inspect any error 

export default class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Hides native splash screen after 2s
    setTimeout(async () => {
      try {
        await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(e); // it's good to catch and inspect any error
      }
    }, 2000);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! üëã</Text>
      </View>
    )
  } 
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
};
```

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in component that initially renders `null`

`App.tsx`
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    appIsReady: false,
  };

  async componentDidMount() {
    // Prevent native splash screen from autohiding
    try {
      await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn(e);
    }
    this.prepareResources();
  }

  /**
   * Method that serves to load resources and make API calls
   */ 
  prepareResources = async () => {
    await performAPICalls(...);
    await downloadAssets(...);

    this.setState({ appIsReady: true }, async () => {
      try {
        await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(e);
      }
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.appIsReady) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! üëã</Text>
      </View>
    )
  } 
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
};
```


## üíª Installation in managed Expo projects

Managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects are not supported by this unimodule at this moment. In managed Expo project please fallback to `Expo.SplashScreen` module that is shipped with `expo` module.

## üñ• Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Add the package to your dependencies

```
expo install expo-splash-screen
```

### üì± Configure for iOS

Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory after installing the package.

### ü§ñ Configure for Android

To achieve fully-native splash screen behavior `expo-splash-screen` needs to be hooked into native view hierarchy and consume some resources that have to placed under `/android/app/src/res` directory.

#### `SplashScreen.show(Activity activity, SplashScreenImageResizeMode mode, Class rootViewClass)`

This native method is used to hook SplashScreen into native view hierarchy that is attached to the provided activity.

You can use this method to parametrize how splash screen view will be presented. Pass one of `SplashScreenImageResizeMode.{CONTAIN, COVER, NATIVE}` as second argument to do so.

#### `MainActivity.{java,kt}`

Modify `MainActivity.{java,kt}` or any other activity that is marked in main `AndroidManifest.xml` as a starting activity of your application.
Ensure `SplashScreen.show(...)` method is called after `super.onCreate(...)`. (If `onCreate` method is not overwritten yet, override it including `SplashScreen.show(...)`).

```diff
+ import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreen;
+ import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {

  // other methods

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
+   // SplashScreen.show(...) has to called after super.onCreate(...)
+   SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class);
    ...
  }

  // other methods
}
```

#### `AndroidManifest.xml`

Adjust your application main `AndroidManifest.xml` to contain `android:theme` property pointing to the style that contains splash screen configuration:

```diff
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">

  ...

  <application ...>

+   <!-- Ensure that 'android:theme' property is pointing to the style containing native splash screen reference - see 'styles.xml' -->
    <activity
      android:name=".MainActivity"
+     android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
      ...
    >
      ...
    </activity>
  </application>

</manifest>

```

#### `res/values/styles.xml`

Locate your main activity theme in `/android/app/src/res/values/styles.xml` or create one if missing.

```diff
  <!-- Main activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
+   <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item> <!-- this line instructs the system to use 'splashscreen.xml' as a background of the whole application -->
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

#### `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`

File containing description how splash screen view should be drawn by the Android system.
Create the file with the following content:

```diff
+ <layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
+   <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ </layer-list>
```

##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've selected `SplashScreenImageResizeMode.NATIVE` mode, you have to add the followings:

```diff
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ <item>
+   <bitmap android:gravity="center" android:src="@drawable/splashscreen_image"/>
+ </item>
</layer-list>
```


#### `res/values/colors.xml`

File containing colors that are reused across your application on native level.
Update the file with the following content or create one if missing:

```diff
<resources>
+ <color name="splashscreen_background">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
  <!-- Other colors defined for your application -->
</resources>
```

#### `res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png`

You have to provide splash screen image and place it under `res/drawable` directory.
This image will be loaded as soon as view Android mounts your application's native view hierarchy.

##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've selected `SplashScreenImageResizeMode.NATIVE` mode, you will have to do a few additional steps.

In your application's `res` directory you might want to have number of `drawable-X` sub-directories (where `X` is the different DPI for different devices). These store your properly scaled images that are selected depending on the device's DPI (for more information please see [this official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskProvideAltBmp)).

To achieve proper scaling of your splash screen image on every device you should have following directories:
- `res/drawable-mdpi` - scale 1x - resources for medium-density (mdpi) screens (~160dpi). (This is the baseline density.)
- `res/drawable-hdpi` - scale 1.5x - resources for high-density (hdpi) screens (~240dpi).
- `res/drawable-xhdpi` - scale 2x - resources for extra-high-density (xhdpi) screens (~320dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxhdpi` - scale 3x - resources for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens (~480dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi` - scale 4x - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi) uses (~640dpi).

Each of above mentioned directories should contain the same `splashscreen_image.png` file, but with different resolution (scale factors above).

Contributions are very welcome! Please refer to guidelines described in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/expo/expo#contributing).

# ‚ùì Known issues

### iOS caching

Splash Screens on iOS apps can sometimes encounter a caching issue where the previous image will flash before showing the new, intended image. When this occurs, we recommend you try power cycling your device and uninstalling and re-installing the application. However,the caching sometimes can persist for a day or two so be patient if the aforementioned steps were unable to resolve the issue.

### NATIVE mode pushes splash image up a little bit

See `NATIVE` mode preview above.
This one will be addressed ASAP.
