# Installation in managed Expo projects

Managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects are not supported by this unimodule at this moment.

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Add the package to your dependencies

```
expo install expo-splash-screen
```

### Configure for iOS

Upcoming `expo-splash-screen` command would take care of the installation process.

Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory after installing the package.

### Configure for Android

Upcoming `expo-splash-screen` command would take care of the installation process.
